GLOBAL:Musician				attribute	Narrative description of the musician such as position, behavior, or personal data if not data-protected, e.g., 'Christiane Schmidt sitting on the chair', or 'artificial excitation by R2D2'.
GLOBAL:Description				attribute	Narrative description of a measurement. For musical instruments/singers, the note (C1, D1, etc) or the dynamic (pp., ff., etc), or the string played, the playing style (pizzicato, legato, etc.), or the type of excitation (e.g., hit location of a cymbal). For loudspeakers, the system and driver units.

EmitterDescription	{''}		IS, MS	string	A more detailed structure of the source. In a simple setting, a single Emitter is considered that is collocated with the source. In a more complicated setting, this may be the strings of a violin or the units of a loudspeaker.
MIDINote	0		I, M	double	Defines the note played by the source during the measurement. The note is specified a MIDI note by the [https://www.midi.org/specifications-old/item/the-midi-1-0-specification MIDI specifications, version 1.0]. Not mandatory, but recommended for tonal instruments.
Description	{''}		MS	string	This variable is used when the description varies with M.
