% [groupDelay_k, f] = AKsweepDistortion(groupDelay, N, fs, K)
%
% numerically calculates, and plots the frequency dependend group delay
% of non-harmonic distortion products of impulse responses measured with
% swept sines. This is usefull, when non-harmonic distortion products
% should be analyzed.
%
% See AKsweepFD.m for example (parameter do_advanced_plot)
%
% I N P U T
% groupDelay   - group delay as passed from AKsweepSynth.m, i.e. single
%                sided spectrum.
% N            - length of original sweep in samples (If NFFT_double=1
%                during the call of AKsweepSynth, pass 2*N to this
%                function)
% fs           - sampling frequency in Hz
% K            - highest order of non-harmonic distortion products that is
%                analyzed, and plottet (default = 5)
%
% O U T P U T
% gourpDelay_k - frequency dependent gourp delay of non-harmonic distortion
%                products in seconds
% f            - frequencies of groupDelay_k
