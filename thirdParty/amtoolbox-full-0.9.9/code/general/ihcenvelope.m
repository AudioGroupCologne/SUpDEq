%IHCENVELOPE   Inner hair cell envelope extration
%   Usage:  outsig=ihcenvelope(insig,fs,methodname);
%
%   IHCENVELOPE(insig,fs,methodname) extract the envelope of an input signal
%   insig sampled with a sampling frequency of fs Hz. The envelope
%   extraction is performed by half-wave rectification followed by low pass
%   filtering. This is a common model of the signal transduction of the
%   inner hair cells.
%
%   The parameter methodname describes the kind of low pass filtering to
%   use. The name refers to a set of papers where in this particular
%   method has been utilized or studied. The options are
%
%     'ihc_bernstein'  Compute the Hilbert envelope, compress the envelope
%                      by raising it to the power .2, combine the envelope
%                      with the original fine-structure, half-wave rectify it, 
%                      square it and low-pass filter it with a cut-off
%                      frequency of 425 Hz. This method is defined in
%                      Bernstein (1999). Note that this method includes both a
%                      compression and an expansion stage.
%
%     'ihc_breebaart'  Use a 5th order filter with a cut-off frequency of 770
%                      Hz. This method is given in Breebaart (2001). Page
%                      94 in Breebart's thesis.
%
%     'ihc_filter_order',n
%                      Filter order for the Breebaart filter, default: 5.
%
%     'ihc_dau'        Use a 1st-order Butterworth filter with a cut-off
%                      frequency of 1000 Hz. This method has been used in all
%                      models deriving from the original 1996 model by 
%                      Dau et. al. These models are mostly monaural in nature.
%
%     'hilbert'        Use the Hilbert envelope instead of the half-wave
%                      rectification and low pass filtering. This is not a
%                      releastic model of the inner hair envelope extraction
%                      process, but the option is included for
%                      completeness. The Hilbert envelope was first suggested
%                      for signal analysis in Gabor (1946).
%
%     'ihc_lindemann'  Use a 1st order Butterworth filter with a cut-off
%                      frequency of 800 Hz. This method is defined in the
%                      Lindemann (1986a) paper.
%
%     'ihc_meddis'     Use the Meddis inner hair cell model.
%
%     'minlvl'         Set all values in the output equal to minlvl.
%                      This ensures that the output is non-negative and
%                      that further processing is not affected by
%                      unnaturally small values. The default value of []
%                      means to not do this.
%
%     'dim',d          Work along dimension d.
