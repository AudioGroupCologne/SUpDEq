function outsig=filterbankz(b,a,insig,hopsize)
%FILTERBANKZ  Filter bank with zero boundary condition
%   Usage: outsig=filterbankz(b,a,insig);
%          outsig=filterbankz(b,a,insig,hopsize);
%
%   FILTERBANKZ(b,a,insig,hopsize) filters the input signal with the
%   filters described in a and b. hopsize is a vector with a length
%   equal to the number of filters. Each channel is sub-sampled by the
%   corresponding hopsize.
%
%   If a and b are matrices then each row corresponds to a subband
%   channel.
%
%   If insig is a matrix then filtering is applied along the columns.
%
%   The output coefficients are stored a cell array. More precisely, the
%   n'th cell of c, c{m}, is a 2D matrix of size M(n) xW and
%   containing the output from the m'th channel subsampled at a rate of
%   a(m).  c{m}(n,l) is thus the value of the coefficient for time index
%   n, frequency index m and signal channel l.
