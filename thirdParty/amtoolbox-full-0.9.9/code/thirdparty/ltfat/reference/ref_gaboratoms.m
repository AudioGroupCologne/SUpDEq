function G=ref_gaboratoms(g,spoints);
%REF_GABORATOMS  Create Gabor transformation matrix
%   Usage:  G=ref_gaboratoms(g,spoints);
%
%   Given a set a TF-sampling points, as returned
%   by REF_GABORLATTICE, returns the corresponding
%   Gabor matrix. Each column of the output matriorx is
%   a Gabor atom.
