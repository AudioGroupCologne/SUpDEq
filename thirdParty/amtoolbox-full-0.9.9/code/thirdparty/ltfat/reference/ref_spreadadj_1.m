function cadj=ref_spreadadj_1(coef);
%REF_SPREADADJ  Symbol of adjoint preading function.
%   Usage: cadj=ref_spreadadj_1(c);
%
%   cadj=SPREADADJ(c) will compute the symbol cadj of the spreading
%   operator that is the adjoint of the spreading operator with symbol c.
%
%   The algorithm uses an explit algorithm to compute the entries.
