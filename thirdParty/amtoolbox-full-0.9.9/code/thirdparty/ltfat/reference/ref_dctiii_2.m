function c=ref_dctiii_2(f)
%DCTII  Reference Discrete Consine Transform type III
%   Usage:  c=ref_dctiii_2(f);
%
%   The transform is real (only works for real input data) and
%   it is orthonormal.
%
%   The transform is computed as the exact inverse of DCTII, i.e. all
%   steps in the DCTII are reversed in order of computation.
%
%   NOT WORKING
