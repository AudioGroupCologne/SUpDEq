function coef=ref_spreadfun(T)
%REF_SPREADFUN  Spreading function.
%   Usage:  c=ref_spreadfun(T);
%
%   REF_SPREADFUN(T) computes the spreading function of the operator T. The
%   spreading function represent the operator T as a weighted sum of
%   time-frequency shifts. See the help text for SPREADOP for the exact
%   definition.
