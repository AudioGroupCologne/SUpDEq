function [V]=ref_hermbasis(L)
%REF_HERMBASIS  Orthonormal basis of discrete Hermite functions.
%   Usage:  V=hermbasis(L);
%
%   HERMBASIS(L) will compute an orthonormal basis of discrete Hermite
%   functions of length L. The vectors are returned as columns in the
%   output.
%
%   All the vectors in the output are eigenvectors of the discrete Fourier
%   transform, and resemble samplings of the continuous Hermite functions
%   to some degree.
