function [lat]=ref_lattice(V,L);
%REF_LATTICE  List of lattice points.
%   Usage:  lat=ref_lattice(V,L)  
%
%   Returns the lattice given by av and bv.
%   The output format is a 2xMxN matrix, where
%   each column is a point on the lattice.
%
%   The lattice must be in lower triangular Hermite normal form.
