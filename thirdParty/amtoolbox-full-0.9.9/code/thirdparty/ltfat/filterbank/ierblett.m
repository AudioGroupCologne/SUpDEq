function fr = ierblett(c,g,shift,Ls,dual)
%IERBLETT  ERBlet non-stationary Gabor synthesis
%   Usage: fr = ierblett(c,g,shift,Ls,dual)
%          fr = ierblett(c,g,shift,Ls)
%          fr = ierblett(c,g,shift)
%
%   Input parameters: 
%         c         : Transform coefficients (matrix or cell array)
%         g         : Cell array of Fourier transforms of the analysis 
%                     windows
%         shift     : Vector of frequency shifts
%         Ls        : Original signal length (in samples)
%         dual      : Synthesize with the dual frame
%   Output parameters:
%         fr        : Synthesized signal (Channels are stored in the 
%                     columns)
%   Given the cell array c of non-stationary Gabor coefficients, and a 
%   set of filters g and frequency shifts shift this function computes 
%   the corresponding ERBlet synthesis.
%
%   If dual is set to 1 (default), an attempt is made to compute the 
%   canonical dual frame for the system given by g, shift and the size 
%   of the vectors in c. This provides perfect reconstruction in the 
%   painless case, see the references for more information.
