function gdout=filterbankdual(g,a,varargin)
%FILTERBANKDUAL  Dual filters
%   Usage:  gd=filterbankdual(g,a,L);
%           gd=filterbankdual(g,a);
%           
%
%   FILTERBANKDUAL(g,a,L) computes the canonical dual filters of g for a
%   channel subsampling rate of a (hop-size) and system length L.
%   L must be compatible with subsampling rate a as 
%   L==filterbanklength(L,a). This will create a dual frame valid for 
%   signals of length L. 
%
%   filterabankrealdual(g,a) does the same, but the filters must be FIR
%   filters, as the transform length is unspecified. L will be set to 
%   next suitable length equal or bigger than the longest impulse response
%   such that L=filterbanklength(gl_longest,a).
%
%   The input and output format of the filters g are described in the
%   help of FILTERBANK.
%
%   In addition, the funtion recognizes a 'forcepainless' flag which
%   forces treating the filterbank g and a as a painless case
%   filterbank.  
%
%   To actually invert the output of a filterbank, use the dual filters
%   together with the IFILTERBANK function.
%
%   REMARK: In general, perfect reconstruction can be obtained for signals 
%   of length L. In some cases, using dual system calculated for shorter
%   L might work but check the reconstruction error.
