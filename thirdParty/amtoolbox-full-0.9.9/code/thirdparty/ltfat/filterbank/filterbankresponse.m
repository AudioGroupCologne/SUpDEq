function gf=filterbankresponse(g,a,L,varargin)
%FILTERBANKRESPONSE  Response of filterbank as function of frequency
%   Usage:  gf=filterbankresponse(g,a,L);
%      
%   gf=FILTERBANKRESPONSE(g,a,L) computes the total response in frequency
%   of a filterbank specified by g and a for a signal length of
%   L. This corresponds to summing up all channels. The output is a
%   usefull tool to investigate the behaviour of the windows, as peaks
%   indicate that a frequency is overrepresented in the filterbank, while
%   a dip indicates that it is not well represented.
%
%   CAUTION: This function computes a sum of squares of modulus of the 
%   frequency responses, which is  also the diagonal of the Fourier 
%   transform of the frame operator.
%   Use FILTERBANKFREQZ for evaluation or plotting of frequency responses
%   of filters.
%
%   FILTERBANKRESPONSE(g,a,L,'real') does the same for a filterbank
%   intended for positive-only filterbank.
%
%   FILTERBANKRESPONSE(g,a,L,fs) specifies the sampling rate fs. This
%   is only used for plotting purposes.
%
%   gf=FILTERBANKRESPONSE(g,a,L,'individual') returns responses 
%   in frequency of individual filters as columns of a matrix. The total
%   response can be obtained by gf = sum(gf,2). 
%
%   FILTERBANKRESPONSE takes the following optional parameters:
%
%      'fs',fs    
%                 Sampling rate, used only for plotting.
%
%      'complex'  
%                 Assume that the filters cover the entire frequency
%                 range. This is the default.
%
%      'real'     
%                 Assume that the filters only cover the positive
%                 frequencies (and is intended to work with real-valued
%                 signals only).
%
%      'noplot'   
%                 Don't plot the response, just return it.
%
%      'plot'     
%                 Plot the response using PLOTFFTREAL or PLOTFFT.
