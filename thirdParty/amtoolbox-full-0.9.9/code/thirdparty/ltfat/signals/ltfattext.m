function s=ltfattext();
%LTFATTEXT  Load the 'ltfattext' test image
%   Usage: s=ltfattext;
% 
%   LTFATTEXT loads a 401 x600 black and white image of the word
%   'LTFAT'.
% 
%   The image is assumed to be used as a spectrogram with 800 channels
%   as produced by DGTREAL.
% 
%   The returned matrix s consists of the integers 0 and 1, which have
%   been converted to double precision.
% 
%   To display the image, use imagesc with a gray colormap:
% 
%     imagesc(ltfattext);
%     colormap(gray);
%     axis('xy');
