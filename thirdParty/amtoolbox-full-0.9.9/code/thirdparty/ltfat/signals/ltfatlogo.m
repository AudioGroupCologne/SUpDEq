function [s,fs]=ltfatlogo()
%LTFATLOGO  Load the 'ltfatlogo' test signal
%   Usage:  s=ltfatlogo;
%
%   LTFATLOGO loads the 'ltfatlogo' signal. This is a sound synthezised
%   from an artificial spectrogram of the word 'LTFAT'. See the help of
%   LTFATTEXT.
%
%   [sig,fs]=LTFATLOGO additionally returns the sampling frequency fs.
%
%   The signal is 7200 samples long and recorded at 8 kHz. It has been
%   scaled to not produce any clipping.
%
%   Examples:
%   ---------
%
%   To produce a spectrogram of the logo, use:
%
%     sgram(ltfatlogo,8000,90);
