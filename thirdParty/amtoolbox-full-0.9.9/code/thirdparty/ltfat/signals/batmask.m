function c=batmask()
%BATMASK  Load a Gabor multiplier symbol for the 'bat' test signal
%   Usage:  c=batmask;
%
%   BATMASK loads a Gabor multiplier with a 0/1 symbol that masks out
%   the main contents of the 'bat' signal. The symbol fits a Gabor
%   multiplier with lattice given by a=10 and M=40.
%
%   The mask was created manually using a image processing program. The
%   mask is symmetric, such that the result will be real valued if the
%   multiplier is applied to a real valued signal using a real valued
%   window.
