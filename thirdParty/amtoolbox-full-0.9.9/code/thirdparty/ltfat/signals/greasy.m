function [s,fs]=greasy()
%GREASY  Load the 'greasy' test signal
%   Usage:  s=greasy;
%
%   GREASY loads the 'greasy' signal. It is a recording of a woman
%   pronouncing the word "greasy".
%
%   The signal is 5880 samples long and recorded at 16 kHz with around 11
%   bits of effective quantization.
%
%   [sig,fs]=GREASY additionally returns the sampling frequency fs.
%
%   The signal has been scaled to not produce any clipping when
%   played. To get integer values use round(GREASY*2048).
%
%   The signal was obtained from Wavelab:
%   http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~wavelab/, it is a part of the first
%   sentence of the TIMIT speech corpus "She had your dark suit in greasy
%   wash water all year":
%   http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC93S1.
%
%   Examples:
%   ---------
%
%   Plot of 'greasy' in the time-domain:
%
%     plot((1:5880)/16000,greasy);
%     xlabel('Time (seconds)');
%     ylabel('Amplitude');
%
%   Plot of 'greasy' in the frequency-domain:
%
%     plotfftreal(fftreal(greasy),16000,90);
%
%   Plot of 'greasy' in the time-frequency-domain:
%
%     sgram(greasy,16000,90);
