 *              the memory.  Although by the time the structure is freed the

 *              prhs - pointer to array of mexFunction input arguments
 *
 *          Requires between 3 and 8 right-hand side arguments (ie nrhs
 *          between 3 and 8, and prhs with at least this many elements).
 *          These elements store, in order, sampleRate, playDevice,
 *          recDevice, playMaxChannel, recMaxChannel, framesPerBuffer,
 *          playSuggestedLatency, recSuggestedLatency.
 *          Where:
 *  sampleRate
 *      the sample rate at which both devices will operate
 *  playDevice
 *      the ID of the device to be used for output (as returned by
 *      'getDevices'), or -1 for no device (ie output not required)
 *  recDevice
 *      the ID of the device to be used for recording (as returned by
 *      'getDevices'), or -1 for no device (ie recording not required)
 *  playMaxChannel {optional}
 *      a number greater than or equal to the maximum channel that will be used
 *      for output.  This must be less than or equal to the maximum number of
 *      output channels that the device supports.  Value ignored if playDevice
 *      is -1.
 *  recMaxChannel {optional}
 *      a number greater than or equal to the maximum channel that will be used
 *      for recording.  This must be less than or equal to the maximum number
 *      of input channels that the device supports.  Value ignored if recDevice
 *      is -1.
 * framesPerBuffer {optional}
 *      the number of samples to be processed in each callback within the
 *      utility (ie the length of each block of samples sent by the utility to
 *      the soundcard).  The lower the value specified the shorter the latency
 *      but also the greater the likelihood of glitches within the audio.
 *      A value of 0 lets the utility use an optimal, and potentially different,
 *      value in each callback.
 * playSuggestedLatency {optional}
 *      the play latency, in seconds, the device should try to use where possible.
 *      Defaults to the default low output latency for the device if not specified.
 * recSuggestedLatency {optional}
 *      the record latency, in seconds, the device should try to use where possible.
 *      Defaults to the default low input latency for the device if not specified.
 *
 * Returns:     true if stream opened succesfully or there is no stream to open
 *              (ie both playDevice and recDevice are -1).  Otherwise false after
 *              an appropriate error message has been displayed in the MATLAB
 *              command window.
 *
 * Description: Initialises the PortAudio stream based on the arguments supplied.
 *              If the maxChannel values are not specified, the maximum channel
 *              number supported by the relevant device is determined and used.  If
 *              the framesPerBuffer value is not specified, the default, as set in
 *              newStreamInfoStruct() is used.  All other initialisation values used
 *              are also set in this other function.
 *
 *              Note that this also starts the PortAudio stream, so by the end, or
 *              shortly afterwars, the playrecCallback() function will start being
 *              called.

soundcards using PortAudio, a free, open-source audio I/O library. It can be used on \
different platforms (Windows, Macintosh, Unix) and access the soundcard via different \
host API including ASIO, WMME and DirectSound under Windows.\n\n\
A list of all commands implemented by the utility can be obtained by calling playrec \
with no arguments.  A basic outline of how to use this utility is provided by typing \
'overview' as the first argument.  For more information on any command type 'help' as \
the first argument followed by the command of interest as the second argument.\n\n\
This utility was initially written as part of a Robert Humphrey's MEng project for \

Hearing) at The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm and was funded by \

      "This page provides a basic outline of how to use the Playrec utility. More information \
on any command can be found by using \"playrec('help', 'command_name')\" or simply \
\"playrec help command_name\".\n\n"
      "To simplify operation, all functionality is accessed through one function in Matlab.  \
To achieve this the first argument in the function call is always the name of the \
command/operation required, eg \"playrec('getDevices')\" or \"playrec('isInitialised')\". \
If additional arguments are required then they are specified after this, eg \
\"playrec('init', 48000, 1, -1)\". A list of all available commands can be displayed by \
supplying no arguments.\n\n"
      "Before any audio can be played or recorded, the utility must be initialised to use the \
required sample rate and device(s).  Initialisation is achieved using the \"init\" \
command, supplying the ID of the required audio device(s) as returned by \"getDevices\". \
Once successfully initialised, the sample rate or device(s) to be used cannot be changed \
without first resetting the utility using the \"reset\" command.  This clears all \
previously recorded data so use it with care. To check if the utility is currently \
initialised, use the \"isInitialised\" command.\n\n"
      "The utility divides time up into pages with no restrictions on the duration of any one \
page, although with very short pages skipping in the audio may occur if they cannot be \
supplied fast enough. There can be as many pages as required provided the utility can \
allocate enough memory. Pages are joined together sequentially in the order they are \
added, with each page starting the sample after the previous page finishes.  A page can \
contain samples that are to be output on one or more channels and buffers to store \
recorded samples on one or more channels.  The duration of a page is determined by the \
longest channel contained within the page.  Therefore if, for example, the record channels \
are 1000 samples long whilst output channels are only 900 samples long, the page will be \
1000 samples long and the final 100 output samples of the page will automatically be set \
to 0.\n\n"
      "When each page is added, the channels that are to be used for recording and/or output are \
specified (depending on the command used to add the page).  The channels used must be \
within the range specified during initialisation and no channel can be duplicated within a \
channel list.  Within these limits, the channel list for each page can be different and \
each list can contain as many or as few channels as required in any order.  All output \
channels not provided with any data within a page will output 0 for the duration of the \
page.  Similarly, during any times when there are no further pages to process 0 will be \
output on all channels.\n\n"
      "Each page has a unique number which is returned by any of the commands used to add pages \
(\"playrec\", \"play\" or \"rec\").  When a page is added, the utility does not wait until \
the page has completed before returning.  Instead, the page is queued up and the page \
number can then be used to check if the page has finished, using \"isFinished\".  \
Alternatively a blocking command, \"block\", can be used to wait until the page has \
finished.  To reduce the amount of memory used, finished pages are automatically condensed \
whenever any command is called in the utility.  If a page contains any recorded data, this \
is left untouched although any output data within the page is removed.  If the page does \
not contain any recorded data, the whole page is deleted during this page condensing.  For \
this reason if either \"isFinished\", \"block\" or \"delPage\" indicate the page number is \
invalid this means the page either never existed or has already finished and then been \
deleted during page condensing.\n\n"
      "For pages containing recorded data, the data can be accessed using the \"getRec\" command \
once the page is finished (indicating the recording has completed).  This does not delete \
the data so it can be accessed as many times as required.  To delete the recorded data, \
the whole page must be deleted using the \"delPage\" command.  This command will delete \
pages nomatter what their current state: waiting to start, currently active or finished.  \
If no page number is supplied, all pages will be deleted, again regardless of their state \
so use with care.\n\n"
      "To ascertain which pages are still left in memory, the \"getPageList\" command can be \
used, returning a list of the pages in chronological order.  NOTE: there may have been \
gaps of silence or other pages between consecutive pages in this list due to pages either \
being automatically or explicitly deleted as detailed above.  To determine if there were \
gaps between pages due to all pages finishing processing before new ones are added, the \
commands \"getSkippedSampleCount\" and \"resetSkippedSampleCount\" can be used.\n\n"
      "The page that is currently being output is returned by \"getCurrentPosition\", along with \
an approximate sample position within the page.  Additionally, the page number of the last \
completed page still resident in memory is returned by \"getLastFinishedPage\".  NOTE: \
this might not be the most recent page to finish if that page has been deleted either \
during page condensing (ie contained no recorded data) or through the use of \"delPage\".\n\n"
      "Finally, the utility can be paused and resumed using the \"pause\" command.  This will \
manipulate all output and recording channels simultaneously to ensure synchronisation is \
always maintained.  This command can also be used to ascertain if the utility is currently \
running or paused.";
