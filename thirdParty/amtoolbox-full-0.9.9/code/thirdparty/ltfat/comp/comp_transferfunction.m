function H=comp_transferfunction(g,L)
%COMP_TRANSFERFUNCTION  Compute the transfer function
%
%  COMP_TRANSFERFUNCTION(g,L) computes length L transfer function 
%  (frequency response) of a single filter g. This function can only
%  handle filters in a proper internal format i.e. already processed by
%  FILTERBANKWIN.
