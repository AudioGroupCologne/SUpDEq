function cout=comp_col2diag(cin);
%COMP_COL2DIAG  transforms columns to diagonals (in a special way)
%
%  This function transforms the first column to the main diagonal. The
%  second column to the first side-diagonal below the main diagonal and so
%  on. 
% 
%  This way fits well the connection of matrix and spreading function, see
%  spreadfun.
%
%  This function is its own inverse.
