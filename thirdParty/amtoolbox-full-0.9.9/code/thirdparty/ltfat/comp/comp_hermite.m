function y = comp_hermite(n, x);
%COMP_HERMITE   Compute sampling of continuous Hermite function.
%   Usage:  y = comp_hermite(n, x);
%
%   COMP_HERMITE(n, x) evaluates the n-th Hermite function at the vector x.
%   The function is normalized to have the L^2(-inf,inf) norm equal to one.
%
%   A minimal effort is made to avoid underflow in recursion.
%   If used to evaluate the Hermite quadratures, it works for n <= 2400
