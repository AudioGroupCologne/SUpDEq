function sr=comp_gabreassign(s,tgrad,fgrad,a);
%COMP_GABREASSIGN  Reassign time-frequency distribution.
%   Usage:  sr = comp_gabreassign(s,tgrad,fgrad,a);
%
%   COMP_GABREASSIGN(s,tgrad,fgrad,a) will reassign the values of the positive
%   time-frequency distribution s using the instantaneous time and frequency
%   fgrad and ifdummy. The lattice is determined by the time shift a and
%   the number of channels deduced from the size of s.
