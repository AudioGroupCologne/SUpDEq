function y = comp_hermite_all(n, x)
%COMP_HERMITE_ALL  Compute all Hermite functions up to an order
%   Usage:  y = hermite_fun_all(n, x);
%
%   This function evaluates the Hermite functions
%   of degree 0 through n-1 at the vector x.
%   The functions are normalized to have the L^2 norm
%   on (-inf,inf) equal to one. No effort is made to 
%   avoid unerflow during recursion.	
%   
%   Input parameters: 
%     n     : the number of Hermite functions
%     x     : the vector of arguments
%
%   Output parameters:
%     y     : the values of the first n Hermite functions at 
%             the nodes x
