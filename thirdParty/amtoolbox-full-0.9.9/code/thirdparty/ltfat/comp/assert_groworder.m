function order=assert_groworder(order)
%ASSERT_GROWORDER  Grow the order parameter
%
%   ASSERT_GROWORDER is meant to be used in conjunction with
%   assert_sigreshape_pre and assert_sigreshape_post. It is used to
%   modify the order parameter in between calls in order to expand the
%   processed dimension by 1, i.e. for use in a routine that creates 2D
%   output from 1D input, for instance in dgt or filterbank.
