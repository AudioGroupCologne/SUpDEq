function g=comp_pchirp(L,n)
%COMP_PCHIRP  Compute periodic chirp
%   Usage:  g=comp_pchirp(L,n);
%
%   pchirp(L,n) returns a periodic, discrete chirp of length L that
%   revolves n times around the time-frequency plane in frequency. n must be
%   an integer number.
%
%   This is a computational routine. Do not call it unless you have
%   verified the input parameters.
