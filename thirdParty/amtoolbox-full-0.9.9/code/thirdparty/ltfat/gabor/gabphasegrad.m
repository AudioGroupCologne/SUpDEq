function [tgrad,fgrad,c]=gabphasegrad(method,varargin)
%GABPHASEGRAD   Phase gradient of the DGT
%   Usage:  [tgrad,fgrad,c] = gabphasegrad('dgt',f,g,a,M);
%           [tgrad,fgrad]   = gabphasegrad('phase',cphase,a);
%           [tgrad,fgrad]   = gabphasegrad('abs',s,g,a);
%
%   [tgrad,fgrad]=GABPHASEGRAD(method,...) computes the time-frequency
%   gradient of the phase of the DGT of a signal. The derivative in time
%   tgrad is the relative instantaneous frequency while the frequency 
%   derivative fgrad is the local group delay.
%
%   tgrad and fgrad measure the deviation from the current time and
%   frequency, so a value of zero means that the instantaneous frequency is
%   equal to the center frequency of the considered channel. 
%
%   tgrad is scaled such that distances are measured in samples. Similarly,
%   fgrad is scaled such that the Nyquist frequency (the highest possible
%   frequency) corresponds to a value of L/2. The absolute time and 
%   frequency positions can be obtained as
%
%      tgradabs = bsxfun(@plus,tgrad,fftindex(M)*L/M);
%      fgradabs = bsxfun(@plus,fgrad,(0:L/a-1)*a);
%
%   The computation of tgrad and fgrad is inaccurate when the absolute
%   value of the Gabor coefficients is low. This is due to the fact the the
%   phase of complex numbers close to the machine precision is almost
%   random. Therefore, tgrad and fgrad may attain very large random values
%   when abs(c) is close to zero.
%
%   The computation can be done using four different methods.
%
%     'dgt'    Directly from the signal using algorithm by Auger and
%              Flandrin.
%
%     'cross'  Directly from the signal using algorithm by Nelson. 
%
%     'phase'  From the phase of a DGT of the signal. This is the
%              classic method used in the phase vocoder.
%
%     'abs'    From the absolute value of the DGT. Currently this
%              method works only for Gaussian windows.
%
%   [tgrad,fgrad]=GABPHASEGRAD('dgt',f,g,a,M) computes the time-frequency
%   gradient using a DGT of the signal f. The DGT is computed using the
%   window g on the lattice specified by the time shift a and the number
%   of channels M. The algorithm used to perform this calculation computes
%   several DGTs, and therefore this routine takes the exact same input
%   parameters as DGT.
%
%   The window g may be specified as in DGT. If the window used is
%   'gauss', the computation will be done by a faster algorithm.
%
%   [tgrad,fgrad,c]=GABPHASEGRAD('dgt',f,g,a,M) additionally returns the
%   Gabor coefficients c, as they are always computed as a byproduct of the
%   algorithm.
%
%   [tgrad,fgrad]=GABPHASEGRAD('cross',f,g,a,M) does the same as above
%   but this time using algorithm by Nelson which is based on computing 
%   several DGTs.
%
%   [tgrad,fgrad]=GABPHASEGRAD('phase',cphase,a) computes the phase
%   gradient from the phase cphase of a DGT of the signal. The original DGT
%   from which the phase is obtained must have been computed using a
%   time-shift of a using the default phase convention ('freqinv') e.g.:
%
%        [tgrad,fgrad]=gabphasegrad('phase',angle(dgt(f,g,a,M)),a)
%
%   [tgrad,fgrad]=GABPHASEGRAD('abs',s,g,a) computes the phase gradient
%   from the spectrogram s. The spectrogram must have been computed using
%   the window g and time-shift a e.g.:
%
%        [tgrad,fgrad]=gabphasegrad('abs',abs(dgt(f,g,a,M)),g,a)
%
%   [tgrad,fgrad]=GABPHASEGRAD('abs',s,g,a,difforder) uses a centered finite
%   diffence scheme of order difforder to perform the needed numerical
%   differentiation. Default is to use a 4th order scheme.
%
%   Currently the 'abs' method only works if the window g is a Gaussian
%   window specified as a string or cell array.
