%WIL2RECT  Arrange Wilson coefficients in a rectangular layout
%   Usage:  c=wil2rect(c);
%
%   WIL2RECT(c) rearranges the coefficients c in a rectangular shape. The
%   coefficients must have been obtained from DWILT. After rearrangement
%   the coefficients are placed correctly on the time/frequency-plane.
%
%   The rearranged array is larger than the input array: it contains
%   zeros on the spots where the Wilson transform is missing a DC or
%   Nyquest component.
