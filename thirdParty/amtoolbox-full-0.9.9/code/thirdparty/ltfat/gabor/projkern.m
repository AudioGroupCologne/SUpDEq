function c=projkern(c,p2,p3,p4,p5);
%PROJKERN  Projection onto generating kernel space
%   Usage:  cout=projkern(cin,a);
%           cout=projkern(cin,g,a);
%           cout=projkern(cin,ga,gs,a);
%
%   Input parameters:
%         cin   : Input coefficients
%         g     : analysis/synthesis window
%         ga    : analysis window
%         gs    : synthesis window
%         a     : Length of time shift.
%   Output parameters:
%         cout  : Output coefficients
%
%   cout=PROJKERN(cin,a) projects a set of Gabor coefficients c onto the
%   space of possible Gabor coefficients. This means that cin and cout*
%   synthesize to the same signal. A tight window generated from a Gaussian
%   will be used for both analysis and synthesis.
%
%   The rationale for this function is a follows: Because the coefficient
%   space of a Gabor frame is larger than the signal space (since the frame
%   is redundant) then there are many coefficients that correspond to the
%   same signal.
%
%   Therefore, you might desire to work with the coefficients cin, but you
%   are in reality working with cout.
%
%   cout=PROJKERN(cin,g,a) does the same, using the window g for analysis
%   and synthesis.
%
%   cout=PROJKERN(cin,ga,gs,a) does the same, but for different analysis
%   ga and synthesis gs windows.
