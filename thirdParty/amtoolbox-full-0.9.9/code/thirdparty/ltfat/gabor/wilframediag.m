%WILFRAMEDIAG  Diagonal of Wilson and WMDCT frame operator
%   Usage:  d=wilframediag(g,M,L);
%
%   Input parameters:
%         g     : Window function.
%         M     : Number of channels.
%         L     : Length of transform to do.
%   Output parameters:
%         d     : Diagonal stored as a column vector
%
%   WILFRAMEDIAG(g,M,L) computes the diagonal of the Wilson or WMDCT frame
%   operator with respect to the window g and number of channels M. The
%   diagonal is stored a as column vector of length L.
%
%   The diagonal of the frame operator can for instance be used as a
%   preconditioner.
