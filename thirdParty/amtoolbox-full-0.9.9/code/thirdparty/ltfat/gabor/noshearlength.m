function L=noshearlength(Ls,a,M,lt)
%NOSHEARLENGTH  Transform length that does not require a frequency shear
%   Usage: L=noshearlength(Ls,a,M,lt)
%
%   NOSHEARLENGTH(Ls,a,M,lt) computes the next larger transform length
%   bigger or equal to Ls for which the shear algorithm does not require
%   a frequency side shear for a non-separable Gabor system specified by
%   a, M and lt. 
%
%   This property makes computation of the canonical dual and tight Gabor
%   windows GABDUAL and GABTIGHT and the DGT for a full length window
%   faster, if this transform length is choosen.
