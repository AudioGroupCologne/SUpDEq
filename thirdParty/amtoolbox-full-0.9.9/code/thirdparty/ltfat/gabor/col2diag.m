function cout=col2diag(cin)
%COL2DIAG  Move columns of a matrix to diagonals
%   Usage:  cout=col2diag(cin);
%
%   COL2DIAG(cin) will rearrange the elements in the square matrix cin so
%   that columns of cin appears as diagonals. Column number n will appear
%   as diagonal number -n and L-n, where L is the size of the matrix.
%
%   The function is its own inverse.
%
%   COL2DIAG performs the underlying coordinate transform for spreading
%   function and Kohn-Nirenberg calculus in the finite, discrete setting.
