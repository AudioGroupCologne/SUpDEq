function [a,M,L,N,Ngood]=gabimagepars(Ls,x,y)
%GABIMAGEPARS  Find Gabor parameters to generate image
%   Usage: [a,M,L,N,Ngood]=gabimagepars(Ls,x,y);
%
%   [a,M,L,N,Ngood]=GABIMAGEPARS(Ls,x,y) will compute a reasonable set of
%   parameters a, M and L to produce a nice Gabor 'image' of a signal
%   of length Ls. The approximate number of pixels in the time direction is
%   given as x and the number of pixels in the frequency direction is given
%   as y.
%
%   The output parameter Ngood contains the number of time steps (columns
%   in the coefficients matrix) that contains relevant information. The
%   columns from Ngood until N only contains information from a
%   zero-extension of the signal.
%
%   If you use this function to calculate a grid size for analysis of a
%   real-valued signal (using DGTREAL), please input twice of the desired
%   size y. This is because DGTREAL only returns half as many
%   coefficients in the frequency direction as DGT.
%
%   An example: We wish to compute a Gabor image of a real valued signal f*
%   of length 7500. The image should have an approximate resolution of
%   600 x800 pixels:
%
%     [f,fs]=linus; f=f(4001:4000+7500);
%     [a,M,L,N,Ngood] = gabimagepars(7500,800,2*600);
%     c = dgtreal(f,'gauss',a,M);
%     plotdgtreal(c,a,M,fs,90);
%
%   The size of c is (M/2)+1 xN equal to 601 x700 pixels. 
%
%   For this function to work properly, the specified numbers for x and
%   y must not be large prime numbers.
