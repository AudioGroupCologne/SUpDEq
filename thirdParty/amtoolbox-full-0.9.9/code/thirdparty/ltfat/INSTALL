
--------- Running the toolbox --------------------

In Matlab or Octave type "ltfatstart" as the first command from the
installation directory. This will set up the correct paths.

In Octave you can put this command in your ~/.octaverc file. In Matlab
you can put this command in your startup.m file. Your startup file of
choice should contain some lines like this:

addpath /path/to/ltfat
ltfatstart;

The ltfatstart command will add all the necessary subdirectories (so
please don't add these manually), and it will print a statement
telling you which backend you are currently using.

-------- Compiling the toolbox ------- ------------

- If you wish to use the toolbox with Matlab, see the file INSTALL-Matlab
