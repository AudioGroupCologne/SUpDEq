function [c,Ls] = nsdgtreal(f,g,a,M)
%NSDGTREAL  Non-stationary Discrete Gabor transform for real valued signals
%   Usage:  c=nsdgtreal(f,g,a,M);
%           [c,Ls]=nsdgtreal(f,g,a,M);
%
%   Input parameters:
%         f     : Input signal.
%         g     : Cell array of window functions.
%         a     : Vector of time positions of windows.
%         M     : Vector of numbers of frequency channels.
%   Output parameters:
%         c     : Cell array of coefficients.
%         Ls    : Length of input signal.
%
%   NSDGTREAL(f,g,a,M) computes the non-stationary Gabor coefficients of the
%   input signal f. The signal f can be a multichannel signal, given in
%   the form of a 2D matrix of size Ls xW, with Ls the signal
%   length and W the number of signal channels.
%
%   As opposed to NSDGT only the coefficients of the positive frequencies
%   of the output are returned. NSDGTREAL will refuse to work for complex
%   valued input signals.
%
%   The non-stationary Gabor theory extends standard Gabor theory by
%   enabling the evolution of the window over time. It is therefor necessary
%   to specify a set of windows instead of a single window.  This is done by
%   using a cell array for g. In this cell array, the n'th element g{n}
%   is a row vector specifying the n'th window.
%
%   The resulting coefficients also require a storage in a cell array, as
%   the number of frequency channels is not constant over time. More
%   precisely, the n'th cell of c, c{n}, is a 2D matrix of size
%   M(n)/2+1 xW and containing the complex local spectra of the
%   signal channels windowed by the n'th window g{n} shifted in time at
%   position a(n).  c{n}(m,l) is thus the value of the coefficient for
%   time index n, frequency index m and signal channel l.
%
%   The variable a contains the distance in samples between two
%   consequtive blocks of coefficients. The variable M contains the
%   number of channels for each block of coefficients. Both a and M are
%   vectors of integers.
%
%   The variables g, a and M must have the same length, and the result c*
%   will also have the same length.
%   
%   The time positions of the coefficients blocks can be obtained by the
%   following code. A value of 0 correspond to the first sample of the
%   signal:
%
%     timepos = cumsum(a)-a(1);
%
%   [c,Ls]=NSDGTREAL(f,g,a,M) additionally returns the length Ls of the input 
%   signal f. This is handy for reconstruction:
%
%     [c,Ls]=nsdgtreal(f,g,a,M);
%     fr=insdgtreal(c,gd,a,Ls);
%
%   will reconstruct the signal f no matter what the length of f is, 
%   provided that gd are dual windows of g.
%
%   Notes:
%   ------
%
%   NSDGTREAL uses circular border conditions, that is to say that the signal is
%   considered as periodic for windows overlapping the beginning or the 
%   end of the signal.
%
%   The phaselocking convention used in NSDGTREAL is different from the
%   convention used in the DGT function. NSDGTREAL results are phaselocked (a
%   phase reference moving with the window is used), whereas DGT results are
%   not phaselocked (a fixed phase reference corresponding to time 0 of the
%   signal is used). See the help on PHASELOCK for more details on
%   phaselocking conventions.
