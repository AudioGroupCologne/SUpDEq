function [c,Ls] = unsdgtreal(f,g,a,M)
%UNSDGTREAL  Uniform non-stationary Discrete Gabor transform
%   Usage:  c=unsdgtreal(f,g,a,M);
%           [c,Ls]=unsdgtreal(f,g,a,M);
%
%   Input parameters:
%         f     : Input signal.
%         g     : Cell array of window functions.
%         a     : Vector of time positions of windows.
%         M     : Vector of numbers of frequency channels.
%   Output parameters:
%         c     : Cell array of coefficients.
%         Ls    : Length of input signal.
%
%   UNSDGTREAL(f,g,a,M) computes the non-stationary Gabor coefficients of the
%   input signal f. The signal f can be a multichannel signal, given in
%   the form of a 2D matrix of size Ls xW, with Ls the signal
%   length and W the number of signal channels.
%
%   As opposed to NSDGT only the coefficients of the positive frequencies
%   of the output are returned. UNSDGTREAL will refuse to work for complex
%   valued input signals.
%
%   The non-stationary Gabor theory extends standard Gabor theory by
%   enabling the evolution of the window over time. It is therefore
%   necessary to specify a set of windows instead of a single window.  This
%   is done by using a cell array for g. In this cell array, the n'th
%   element g{n} is a row vector specifying the n'th window. The
%   uniformity means that the number of channels is not allowed to vary over
%   time.
%
%   The resulting coefficients is stored as a M/2+1 xN xW
%   array. c(m,n,l) is thus the value of the coefficient for time index n,
%   frequency index m and signal channel l.
%
%   The variable a contains the distance in samples between two
%   consecutive blocks of coefficients. The variable M contains the
%   number of channels for each block of coefficients. Both a and M are
%   vectors of integers.
%
%   The variables g, a and M must have the same length, and the result c*
%   will also have the same length.
%   
%   The time positions of the coefficients blocks can be obtained by the
%   following code. A value of 0 correspond to the first sample of the
%   signal:
%
%     timepos = cumsum(a)-a(1);
%
%   [c,Ls]=UNSDGTREAL(f,g,a,M) additionally returns the length Ls of the input 
%   signal f. This is handy for reconstruction:
%
%     [c,Ls]=unsdgtreal(f,g,a,M);
%     fr=insdgtreal(c,gd,a,Ls);
%
%   will reconstruct the signal f no matter what the length of f is, 
%   provided that gd are dual windows of g.
%
%   Notes:
%   ------
%
%   UNSDGTREAL uses circular border conditions, that is to say that the signal is
%   considered as periodic for windows overlapping the beginning or the 
%   end of the signal.
%
%   The phaselocking convention used in UNSDGTREAL is different from the
%   convention used in the DGT function. UNSDGTREAL results are phaselocked (a
%   phase reference moving with the window is used), whereas DGT results are
%   not phaselocked (a fixed phase reference corresponding to time 0 of the
%   signal is used). See the help on PHASELOCK for more details on
%   phaselocking conventions.
