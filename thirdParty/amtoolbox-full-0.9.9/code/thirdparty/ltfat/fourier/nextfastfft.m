function [nfft,tableout]=nextfastfft(n)
%NEXTFASTFFT  Next higher number with a fast FFT
%   Usage: nfft=nextfastfft(n);
%
%   NEXTFASTFFT(n) returns the next number greater than or equal to n,
%   for which the computation of a FFT is fast. Such a number is solely
%   comprised of small prime-factors of 2, 3, 5 and 7.
%
%   NEXTFASTFFT is intended as a replacement of nextpow2, which is often
%   used for the same purpose. However, a modern FFT implementation (like
%   FFTW) usually performs well for sizes which are powers or 2,3,5 and 7,
%   and not only just for powers of 2.
%
%   The algorithm will look up the best size in a table, which is computed
%   the first time the function is run. If the input size is larger than the
%   largest value in the table, the input size will be reduced by factors of
%   2, until it is in range.
%
%   [n,nfft]=NEXTFASTFFT(n) additionally returns the table used for
%   lookup.
