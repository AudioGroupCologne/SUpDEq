function f=dctresample(f,L,dim)
%DCTRESAMPLE   Resample signal using Fourier interpolation
%   Usage:  h=dctresample(f,L);
%           h=dctresample(f,L,dim);
%
%   DCTRESAMPLE(f,L) returns a discrete cosine interpolation of the signal f*
%   to length L. If the function is applied to a matrix, it will apply
%   to each column.
%
%   DCTRESAMPLE(f,L,dim) does the same along dimension dim.
%
%   If the input signal is not a periodic signal (or close to), this method
%   will give much better results than FFTRESAMPLE at the endpoints, as
%   this method assumes than the signal is even a the endpoints.
%
%   The algorithm uses a DCT type iii.
