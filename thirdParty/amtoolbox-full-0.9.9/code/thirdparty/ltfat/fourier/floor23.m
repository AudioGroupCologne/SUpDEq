function [nfft,tableout]=floor23(n)
%FLOOR23  Previous number with only 2,3 factors
%   Usage: nceil=floor23(n);
%
%   FLOOR23(n) returns the first number less than or equal to n,
%   which can be written as a product of powers of 2 and 3.
%
%   The algorithm will look up the best size in a table, which is computed
%   the first time the function is run. If the input size is larger than the
%   largest value in the table, the input size will be reduced by factors of
%   2, until it is in range.
%
%   [nceil,table]=FLOOR23(n) additionally returns the table used for lookup.
%
%   Examples:
%   ---------
%
%   Return the first number smaller or equal to 26 that can be written
%   solely as products of powers of 2 and 3*:
% 
%     floor23(26)
