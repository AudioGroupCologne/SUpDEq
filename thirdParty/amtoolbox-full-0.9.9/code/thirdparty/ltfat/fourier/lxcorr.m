function h=lxcorr(f,g,varargin)
%LXCORR  Linear crosscorrelation
%   Usage:  h=lxcorr(f,g)
%
%   LXCORR(f) computes the linear crosscorrelation of the input signal f and g. 
%   The linear cross-correlation is computed by
%
%               Lh-1
%      h(l+1) = sum f(k+1) * conj(g(k-l+1))
%               k=0
%
%   with L_{h} = L_{f} + L_{g} - 1 where L_{f} and L_{g} are the lengths of f and g, 
%   respectively.
%
%   LXCORR(f,'normalize') does the same, but normalizes the output by
%   the product of the l^2-norm of f and g.
