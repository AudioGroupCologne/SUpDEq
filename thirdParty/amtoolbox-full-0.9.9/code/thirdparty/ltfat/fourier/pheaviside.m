function h=pheaviside(L)
%PHEAVISIDE  Periodic Heaviside function
%   Usage: h=pheaviside(L);
%
%   PHEAVISIDE(L) returns a periodic Heaviside function. The periodic
%   Heaviside function takes on the value 1 for indices corresponding to
%   positive frequencies, 0 corresponding to negative frequencies and the
%   value .5 for the zero and Nyquist frequencies.
%
%   To get a function that weights the negative frequencies by 1 and the
%   positive by 0, use involute(PHEAVISIDE(L))
%
%   As an example, the PHEAVISIDE function can be use to calculate the
%   Hilbert transform for a column vector f*:
%
%     h=2*ifft(fft(f).*pheaviside(length(f)));
%
