function f=shah(L,a);
%SHAH  Discrete Shah-distribution
%   Usage: f=shah(L,a);
% 
%   SHAH(L,a) computes the discrete, normalized Shah-distribution of
%   length L with a distance of a between the spikes.
%
%   The Shah distribution is defined by 
%
%      f(n*a+1)=1/sqrt(L/a) 
%
%   for integer n, otherwise f is zero.
% 
%   This is also known as an impulse train or as the comb function, because
%   the shape of the function resembles a comb. It is the sum of unit
%   impulses ('diracs') with the distance a.
% 
%   If a divides L, then the DFT of SHAH(L,a) is SHAH(L,L/a).
% 
%   The Shah function has an extremely bad time-frequency localization.
%   It does not generate a Gabor frame for any L and a.
%
%   Examples:
%   ---------
%
%   A simple spectrogram of the Shah function (includes the negative
%   frequencies to display the whole TF-plane):
%
%     sgram(shah(256,16),'dynrange',80,'nf')
