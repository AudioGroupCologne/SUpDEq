function h=pxcorr(f,g,varargin)
%PXCORR  Periodic cross correlation
%   Usage:  h=pxcorr(f,g)
%
%   PXCORR(f,g) computes the periodic cross correlation of the input
%   signals f and g. The cross correlation is defined by
%
%               L-1
%      h(l+1) = sum f(k+1) * conj(g(k-l+1))
%               k=0
%
%   In the above formula, k-l is computed modulo L.
%
%   PXCORR(f,g,'normalize') does the same, but normalizes the output by
%   the product of the l^2-norm of f and g.
