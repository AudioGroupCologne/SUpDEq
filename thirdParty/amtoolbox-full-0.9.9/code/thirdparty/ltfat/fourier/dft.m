function f=dft(f,N,dim);
%DFT   Normalized Discrete Fourier Transform
%   Usage: f=dft(f);
%          f=dft(f,N,dim);
%
%   DFT computes a normalized or unitary discrete Fourier transform. The 
%   unitary discrete Fourier transform is computed by
%   
%                          L-1
%     c(k+1) = 1/sqrt(L) * sum f(l+1)*exp(-2*pi*i*k*l/L)
%                          l=0
%
%   for k=0,...,L-1.
%
%   The output of DFT is a scaled version of the output from fft. The
%   function takes exactly the same arguments as fft. See the help on fft
%   for a thorough description.
