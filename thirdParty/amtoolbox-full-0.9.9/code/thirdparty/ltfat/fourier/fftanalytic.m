%FFTANALYTIC Compute analytic representation
%   Usage:  z = fftanalytic(f);
%           z = fftanalytic(f,L);
%           z = fftanalytic(f,L,dim);
%
%   Input parameters:
%         f     : Input data.
%         L     : Extend or truncate f to this length.
%         dim   : Dimension to along which to apply the computations.
%   Output parameters:
%         z     : Analytic signal.
%
%   FFTANALYTIC(f) computes the analytic representation of a 
%   real-valued signal f. The analytic representation is computed 
%   through the FFT of f. The computations are done along the first 
%   non-singleton dimension. 
%
%   FFTANALYTIC(f,L) acts as before but f is padded with zeros or 
%   truncated to length L.
%
%   FFTANALYTIC(f,L,dim) in addition allows specifying the dimension 
%   along which the computation should be done.
%
%   The real part of the analytic representation z equals the signal 
%   f and the imaginary part is the Hilbert transform of f. 
%
%   The instananeous amplitude (a Hilbert envelope) of the signal f can 
%   be computed as:
%
%     abs(fftanalytic(f));
%
%   The instantaneous phase of the function f can be computed as:
%
%     angle(fftanalytic(f));
