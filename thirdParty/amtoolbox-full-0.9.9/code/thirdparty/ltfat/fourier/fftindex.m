function n=fftindex(N,nyquistzero)
%FFTINDEX  Frequency index of FFT modulations
%   Usage: n=fftindex(N);
%
%   FFTINDEX(N) returns the index of the frequencies of the standard FFT of
%   length N as they are ordered in the output from the fft routine. The
%   numbers returned are in the range -ceil(N/2)+1:floor(N/2)
%
%   FFTINDEX(N,0) does as above, but sets the Nyquist frequency to zero.
