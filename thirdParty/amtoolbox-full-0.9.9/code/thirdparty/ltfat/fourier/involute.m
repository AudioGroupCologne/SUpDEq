function f=involute(f,dim);
%INVOLUTE  Involution 
%   Usage: finv=involute(f);
%          finv=involute(f,dim);
%
%   INVOLUTE(f) will return the involution of f.
%
%   INVOLUTE(f,dim) will return the involution of f along dimension dim.
%   This can for instance be used to calculate the 2D involution:
%
%     f=involute(f,1);
%     f=involute(f,2);
%
%   The involution finv of f is given by:
%
%     finv(l+1)=conj(f(mod(-l,L)+1));
%
%   for l=0,...,L-1.
%
%   The relation between conjugation, Fourier transformation and involution
%   is expressed by:
%
%     conj(dft(f)) == dft(involute(f))
%
%   for all signals f. The inverse discrete Fourier transform can be
%   expressed by:
%
%     idft(f) == conj(involute(dft(f)));
