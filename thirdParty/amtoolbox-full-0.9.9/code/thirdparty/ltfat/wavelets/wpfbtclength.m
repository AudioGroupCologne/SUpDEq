function [Lc,L]=wpfbtclength(Ls,wt,varargin)
%WPFBTCLENGTH  WPFBT subband length from a signal length
%   Usage: Lc=wpfbtclength(Ls,wt);
%          [Lc,L]=wpfbtclength(Ls,wt);
%
%   Lc=WPFBTCLENGTH(Ls,wt) returns the lengths of coefficient subbands 
%   obtained from WPFBT for a signal of length Ls. Please see the help 
%   on WPFBT for an explanation of the parameter wt. 
%
%   [Lc,L]=WPFBTCLENGTH(...) additionally returns the next legal length 
%   of the input signal for the given extension type.
%
%   The function support the same boundary-handling flags as the FWT
%   does.
