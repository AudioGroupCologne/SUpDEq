%WFILTDT_QSHIFT  Improved Orthogonality and Symmetry properties 
%
%   Usage: [h,g,a] = wfiltdt_qshift(N);
%
%   [h,g,a]=WFILTDT_QSHIFT(N) with N in {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} returns 
%   Kingsbury's Q-shift filters suitable for dual-tree complex wavelet 
%   transform.
%   Filters in both trees are orthogonal and based on a single prototype
%   low-pass filter with a quarter sample delay. Other filters are
%   derived by modulation and time reversal such that they fulfil the
%   half-sample delay difference between the trees.   
%
%   Examples:
%   ---------
%   :
%     wfiltdtinfo('qshift3');
