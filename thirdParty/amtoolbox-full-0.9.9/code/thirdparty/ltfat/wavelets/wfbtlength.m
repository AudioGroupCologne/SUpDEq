function L=wfbtlength(Ls,wt,varargin);
%WFBTLENGTH  WFBT length from signal
%   Usage: L=wfbtlength(Ls,wt);
%
%   WFBTLENGTH(Ls,wt) returns the length of a Wavelet system that is long
%   enough to expand a signal of length Ls. Please see the help on
%   WFBT for an explanation of the parameter wt.
%
%   If the returned length is longer than the signal length, the signal
%   will be zero-padded by WFBT to length L.
%
%   In addition, the function accepts flags defining boundary extension
%   technique as in WFBT. The returned length can be longer than the
%   signal length only in case of 'per' (periodic extension).
