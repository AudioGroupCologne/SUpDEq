%WFILT_OPTSYMB  Optimizatized Symmetric Self-Hilbertian Filters 
%
%   Usage: [h,g,a] = wfilt_optsymb(N);
%
%   [h,g,a]=wfiltdt_optsymb(N) with N in {1,2,3} returns filters
%   suitable with optimized symmetry suitable for for dual-tree complex 
%   wavelet transform tree B.
%
%   Examples:
%   ---------
%   :
%     wfiltinfo('optsymb3');
