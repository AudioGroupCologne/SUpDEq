function [c,info]=uwpfbt(f,wt,varargin)
%UWPFBT Undecimated Wavelet Packet FilterBank Tree
%   Usage:  c=uwpfbt(f,wt);
%           [c,info]=uwpfbt(...);
%
%   Input parameters:
%         f   : Input data.
%         wt  : Wavelet Filterbank tree
%
%   Output parameters:
%         c   : Coefficients in a L xM matrix.
%
%   c=UWPFBT(f,wt) returns coefficients c obtained by applying the
%   undecimated wavelet filterbank tree defined by wt to the input data
%   f using the "a-trous" algorithm. Number of columns in c (*M*) is
%   defined by the total number of outputs of each node. The outputs c(:,jj)
%   are ordered in the breadth-first node order manner.
%
%   [c,info]=UWPFBT(f,wt) additionally returns struct. info containing 
%   the transform parameters. It can be conviniently used for the inverse 
%   transform IUWPFBT e.g. fhat = iUWPFBT(c,info). It is also required
%   by the PLOTWAVELETS function.
%
%   If f is a matrix, the transformation is applied to each of W columns
%   and the coefficients in c are stacked along the third dimension.
%
%   Please see help for WFBT description of possible formats of wt.
%
%   Scaling of intermediate outputs:
%   --------------------------------
%
%   The following flags control scaling of intermediate outputs and
%   therefore the energy relations between coefficient subbands. An 
%   intermediate output is an output of a node which is further used as an
%   input to a descendant node.
%
%      'intsqrt'
%               Each intermediate output is scaled by 1/sqrt(2).
%               If the filterbank in each node is orthonormal, the overall
%               undecimated transform is a tight frame.
%               This is the default.
%
%      'intnoscale'
%               No scaling of intermediate results is used. This is
%               necessaty for the WPBEST function to correctly work with
%               the cost measures.
%
%      'intscale'
%               Each intermediate output is scaled by 1/2.
%
%   If 'intnoscale' is used, 'intscale' must be used in IUWPFBT (and vice
%   versa) in order to obtain a perfect reconstruction.
%
%   Scaling of filters:
%   -------------------
%
%   When compared to WPFBT, the subbands produced by UWPFBT are
%   gradually more and more redundant with increasing depth in the tree.
%   This results in energy grow of the coefficients. There are 3 flags
%   defining filter scaling:
%
%      'sqrt'
%               Each filter is scaled by 1/sqrt(a), there a is the hop
%               factor associated with it. If the original filterbank is
%               orthonormal, the overall undecimated transform is a tight
%               frame.
%               This is the default.
%
%      'noscale'
%               Uses filters without scaling.
%
%      'scale'
%               Each filter is scaled by 1/a.
%
%   If 'noscale' is used, 'scale' must be used in IUWPFBT (and vice
%   versa) in order to obtain a perfect reconstruction.
%
%   Examples:
%   ---------
%
%   A simple example of calling the UWPFBT function using the "full
%   decomposition" wavelet tree:
%
%     [f,fs] = greasy;
%     J = 6;
%     [c,info] = uwpfbt(f,{'db10',J,'full'});
%     plotwavelets(c,info,fs,'dynrange',90);
