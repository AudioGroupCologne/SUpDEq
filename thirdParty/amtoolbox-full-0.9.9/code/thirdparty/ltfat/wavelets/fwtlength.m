function L=fwtlength(Ls,w,J,varargin)
%FWTLENGTH  FWT length from signal
%   Usage: L=fwtlength(Ls,w,J);
%
%   FWTLENGTH(Ls,w,J) returns the length of a Wavelet system that is long
%   enough to expand a signal of length Ls. Please see the help on
%   FWT for an explanation of the parameters w and J.
%
%   If the returned length is longer than the signal length, the signal
%   will be zero-padded by FWT to length L.
%
%   In addition, the function accepts flags defining boundary extension
%   technique as in FWT. The returned length can be longer than the
%   signal length only in case of 'per' (periodic extension).
