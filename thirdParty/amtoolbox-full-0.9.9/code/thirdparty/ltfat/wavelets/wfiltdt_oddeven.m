function [h,g,a,info] = wfiltdt_oddeven(N)
%WFILTDT_ODDEVEN  Kingsbury's symmetric odd and even filters
%
%   Usage: [h,g,a] = wfiltdt_oddeven(N);
%
%   [h,g,a]=wfilt_oddeven(N) with N in {1} returns the original odd
%   and even symmetric filters suitable for dual-tree complex wavelet
%   transform. The filters in individual trees are biorthogonal.
%
%   Examples:
%   ---------
%   :
%     wfiltdtinfo('ana:oddeven1');
