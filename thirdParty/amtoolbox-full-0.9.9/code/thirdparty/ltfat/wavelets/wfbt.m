function [c,info]=wfbt(f,wt,varargin)
%WFBT   Wavelet FilterBank Tree
%   Usage:  c=wfbt(f,wt);
%           c=wfbt(f,wt,ext);
%           [c,info]=wfbt(...);
%
%   Input parameters:
%         f     : Input data.
%         wt    : Wavelet filterbank tree definition.
%
%   Output parameters:
%         c    : Coefficients stored in a cell-array.
%         info : Transform parameters struct.
%
%   WFBT(f,wt) returns coefficients c obtained by applying a wavelet
%   filterbank tree defined by wt to the input data f. 
%
%   [c,info]=WFBT(f,wt) additionally returns struct. info containing
%   transform parameters. It can be conviniently used for the inverse 
%   transform IWFBT e.g. fhat = iWFBT(c,info). It is also required by
%   the PLOTWAVELETS function.
%
%   wt defines a tree shaped filterbank structure build from the
%   elementary two (or more) channel wavelet filters. The tree can have any
%   shape and thus provide a flexible frequency covering. The outputs of the
%   tree leaves are stored in c.
%
%   The wt parameter can have two formats: 
%
%   1) Cell array containing 3 elements {w,J,treetype}, where w is
%      the basic wavelet filterbank definition as in FWT function, J*
%      stands for the depth of the tree and the flag treetype defines
%      the type of the tree to be used. Supported options are:
%
%      'dwt'
%         Plain DWT tree (default). This gives one band per octave freq. 
%         resolution when using 2 channel basic wavelet filterbank and
%         produces coefficients identical to the ones in FWT.
%
%      'full'
%         Full filterbank tree. Both (all) basic filterbank outputs are
%         decomposed further up to depth J achieving linear frequency band
%         division.
%
%      'doubleband','quadband','octaband'
%         The filterbank is designed such that it mimics 4-band, 8-band or
%         16-band complex wavelet transform provided the basic filterbank
%         is 2 channel. In this case, J is treated such that it defines
%         number of levels of 4-band, 8-band or 16-band transform.
%
%   2) Structure returned by the WFBTINIT function and possibly
%      modified by WFBTPUT and WFBTREMOVE.
%
%   Please see WFBTINIT for a detailed description and more options.
%
%   If f is row/column vector, the coefficient vectors c{jj} are columns.
%
%   If f is a matrix, the transformation is by default applied to each of
%   W columns [Ls, W]=size(f).
%
%   In addition, the following flag groups are supported:
%
%   'per'(default),'zero','odd','even'
%     Type of the boundary handling. Please see the help on FWT for a 
%     description of the boundary condition flags.
%
%   'freq'(default),'nat'
%     Frequency or natural ordering of the coefficient subbands. The direct
%     usage of the wavelet tree ('nat' option) does not produce coefficient
%     subbans ordered according to the frequency. To achieve that, some
%     filter shuffling has to be done ('freq' option).
%
%   Examples:
%   ---------
%
%   A simple example of calling the WFBT function using the "full 
%   decomposition" wavelet tree:
%
%     f = gspi;
%     J = 7;
%     [c,info] = wfbt(f,{'sym10',J,'full'});
%     plotwavelets(c,info,44100,'dynrange',90);
