function a = treeSub(wt)
%TREESUB  Identical subsampling factors
%   Usage:  a = treeSub(wt)
%
%   Input parameters:
%         wt  : Structure containing description of the filter tree.
%
%   Output parameters:
%         a : Subsampling factors.
%
%   a = TREESUB(wt) returns subsampling factors asociated with the tree
%   subbands. For definition of the structure see WFBINIT.
