function [h,g,a,info] = wfiltdt_optsym(N)
%WFILTDT_OPTSYM  Optimizatized Symmetric Self-Hilbertian Filters 
%
%   Usage: [h,g,a] = wfiltdt_optsym(N);
%
%   [h,g,a]=WFILTDT_OPTSYM(N) with N in {1,2,3} returns filters
%   suitable for dual-tree complex wavelet transform with optimized 
%   symmetry.
%
%   Examples:
%   ---------
%   :
%     wfiltdtinfo('optsym3');
