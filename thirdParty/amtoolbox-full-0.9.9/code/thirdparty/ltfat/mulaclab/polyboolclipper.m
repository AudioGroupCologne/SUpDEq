%
% polyboolclipper : a function to perform boolean set operations on 
%            planar polygons
% 
% INPUT:
% pa : EITHER a nx2 matrix of vertices describing a polygon 
%      OR a cell array with polygons, each of which is a nx2 matrix
%      of vertices (one vertex per row)
% pb : EITHER a nx2 matrix of vertices describing a polygon 
%      OR a cell array with polygons, each of which is a nx2 matrix
%      of vertices (one vertex per row)
% ha : (Optional) logical array with hole flags for polygons in
%      pa. If ha(k) > 0, pa{k} is an interior boundary of a polygon 
%      with at least one hole.
% hb : (Optional) logical array with hole flags for polygons in pb.
% op : type of algebraic operation:
%       'notb' : difference - points in polygon pa and not in polygon pb
%       'and'  : intersection - points in polygon pa and in polygon pb
%       'xor'  : exclusive or - points either in polygon pa or in polygon pb
%       'or'   : union - points in polygons pa or pb
% ug : (Optional) conversion factor from user coordinates to
%      integer grid coordinates. Default is 10^6.
% pc : cell array with the result(s) of the boolean set operation
%      of polygons pa and pb (can be more than one polygon)
% hc : logical array with hole flags for each of the output
%      polygons. If hc(k) > 0, pc{k} is an interior boundary of a 
%      polygon with at least one hole.
