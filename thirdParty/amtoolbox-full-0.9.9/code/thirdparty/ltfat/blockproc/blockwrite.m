function blockwrite(f)
%BLOCKWRITE  Append block to an existing file
%   Usage: blockwrite(f);
%
%   Input parameters:
%      f    : Block stream input.
%
%   Function appends f to a existing file. The file must have been
%   explicitly defined as the 'outfile' parameter of BLOCK prior
%   calling this function. If not, the function does nothing.
%
%   The function expect exactly the same format of f as is returned by
%   BLOCKREAD.
