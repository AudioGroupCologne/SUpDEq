function blockdone(varargin)
%BLOCKDONE  Destroy the current blockstream
%   Usage: blockdone();
%
%   BLOCKDONE() closes the current blockstream. The function resets
%   the playrec tool and clear all buffers in block_interface.
%
%   BLOCKDONE(p1,p2,...) in addition tries to call close methods on
%   all input arguments which are JAVA objects (which are passed by reference).
