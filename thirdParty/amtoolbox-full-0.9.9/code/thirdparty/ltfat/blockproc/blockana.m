function [c, fola] = blockana(F, f, fola)
%BLOCKANA Blockwise analysis interface
%   Usage: c=blockana(F, f)
%
%   Input parameters:
%      Fa   : Analysis frame object.    
%      f    : Block of signal.
%      fola : Explicitly defined overlap
%   Output parameters:
%      c    : Block coefficients.
%      fola : Stored overlap
%
%   c=BLOCKANA(Fa,f) calculates the coefficients c of the signal block f using 
%   the frame defined by F. The block overlaps are handled according to the 
%   F.blokalg. Assuming BLOCKANA is called in the loop only once, fola*
%   can be omitted and the overlaps are handled in the background
%   automatically.
