function ltfatplay(source,varargin)
%LTFATPLAY Play data samples or a wav file
%   Usage: ltfatplay('file.wav')
%          ltfatplay(data,'fs',fs)
%          ltfatplay(...,'devid',devid)
%
%
%   LTFATPLAY('file.wav') plays a wav file using the default sound device.
%
%   LTFATPLAY('file.wav','devid',devid) plays a wav file using the sound
%   device with id devid. A list of available devices can be obtained by 
%   BLOCKDEVICES.
%
%   LTFATPLAY(data,'fs',fs,...) works entirely similar, but data is
%   expected to be a vector of length L or a LxW matrix with
%   columns as individual channels and fs to be a sampling rate to be used.
%   When no sampling rate is specified, 44.1 kHz is used.
%
%   In addition, individual channels of the output sound device can be
%   selected by using an additional key-value pair
%
%   'playch',playch
%      A vector of channel indexes starting at 1.
%
%   This function has the advantage over sound and soundsc that one can 
%   directly specify output device chosen from BLOCKDEVICES. Similar
%   behavior can be achieved using audioplayer and audiodevinfo but
%   only in Matlab. Audioplayer is not yet supported in Octave.
