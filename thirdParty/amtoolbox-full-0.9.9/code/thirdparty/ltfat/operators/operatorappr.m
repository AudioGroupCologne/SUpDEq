function Opout=operatorappr(Op,T)
%OPERATORAPPR  Best approximation by operator
%   Usage: c=operatorappr(Op,K);
%
%   Opout=OPERATORAPPR(Opin,T) computes the an operator Opout of the
%   same type as Opin that best approximates the matrix T in the
%   Frobenious norm of the matrix (the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of the
%   operator).
%
%   For some operator classes, the approximation is always exact, so that
%   operator(Opout,f) computes the exact same result as T'*f.
