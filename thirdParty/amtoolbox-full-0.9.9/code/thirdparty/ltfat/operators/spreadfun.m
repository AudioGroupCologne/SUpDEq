function coef=spreadfun(T)
%SPREADFUN  Spreading function of a matrix
%   Usage:  c=spreadfun(T);
%
%   SPREADFUN(T) computes the spreading function of the operator T,
%   represented as a matrix. The spreading function represent the operator T*
%   as a weighted sum of time-frequency shifts. See the help text for
%   SPREADOP for the exact definition.
