%DEMO_AUDITORYFILTERBANK  Construct an auditory filterbank
%
%   In this file we construct a uniform filterbank using a the impulse
%   response of a 4th order gammatone for each channel. The center frequencies
%   are equidistantly spaced on an ERB-scale, and the width of the filter are
%   choosen to match the auditory filter bandwidth as determined by Moore.
%
%   Each channel is subsampled by a factor of 8 (a=8), and to generate a
%   nice plot, 4 channels per Erb has been used.
%
%   The filterbank covers only the positive frequencies, so we must use
%   FILTERBANKREALDUAL and FILTERBANKREALBOUNDS.

%      A classic spectrogram of the spoken sentense. The dynamic range has
%      been set to 50 dB, to highlight the most important features.
