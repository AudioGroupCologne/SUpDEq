%DEMO_DGT  Basic introduction to DGT analysis/synthesis
%
%   This demo shows how to compute Gabor coefficients of a signal.
%
%   Figure 1: Spectrogram of the 'bat' signal.
%
%      The figure shows a spectrogram of the 'bat' signal. The
%      coefficients are shown on a linear scale.
%
%   Figure 2: Gabor coefficients of the 'bat' signal.
%
%      The figure show a set of Gabor coefficients for the 'bat' signal,
%      computed using a DGT with a Gaussian window. The coefficients
%      contains all the information to reconstruct the signal, even though
%      there a far fewer coefficients than the spectrogram contains.
%
%   Figure 3: Real-valued Gabor analysis
%
%      This figure shows only the coefficients for the positive
%      frequencies. As the signal is real-value, these coefficients
%      contain all the necessary information. Compare to the shape of the
%      spectrogram shown on Figure 1.
%
%   Figure 4: DGT coefficients on a spectrogram
%
%      This figure shows how the coefficients from DGTREAL can be picked
%      from the coefficients computed by a full Short-time Fourier
%      transform, as visualized by a spectrogram.
