%DEMO_FILTERBANKS  CQT, ERBLET and AUDLET filterbanks
%
%   This demo shows CQT (Constant Quality Transform), ERBLET (Equivalent
%   Rectangular Bandwidth -let transform), and AUDLET (Auditory -let) 
%   representations acting as filterbanks  with high and low redundancies.
%   Note that ERBLET and AUDLET are similar concepts. The main difference
%   is that ERBlet uses only the perceptual ERB scale while AUDlet allows
%   for various perceptual scales like Bark or Mel scales. In short,
%   ERBFILTERS is a wrapper of AUDFILTERS for the ERB scale. 
%   Filterbanks are build such that the painless condition is always satisfied.
%   Real input signal and filters covering only the positive frequency range 
%   are used. The redundancy is calculated as a ratio of the number of (complex) 
%   coefficients and the input length times two to account for the storage
%   requirements of complex numbers.
%
%      The high redundancy representation uses 'uniform' subsampling i.e.
%       all channels are subsampled with the same subsampling factor which
%       is the lowest from the filters according to the painless condition
%       rounded towards zero.
%
%      The low redundancy representation uses 'fractional' subsampling
%       which results in the least redundant representation still
%       satisfying the painless condition. Actual time positions of atoms 
%       can be non-integer, hence the word fractional.
%
%   Figure 1: ERBLET representations
%
%      The high-redundany plot (top) consists of 400 channels (~9 filters 
%      per ERB) and low-redundany plot (bottom) consists of 44 channels 
%      (1 filter per ERB).
%
%   Figure 2: CQT representations
%
%      Both representations consist of 280 channels (32 channels per octave,
%      frequency range 50Hz-20kHz). The high-redundany represention is on 
%      the top and the low-redundancy repr. is on the bottom.
% 
%   Figure 3: AUDLET representations
%
%      The first representation consists of 72 channels BARKlet FB (3 filters
%      per Bark in the frequency range 100Hz-16kHz using fractional subsampling.
%      The second representation consists of 40 channels MELlet FB using
%      uniform subsampling and triangular windows.
