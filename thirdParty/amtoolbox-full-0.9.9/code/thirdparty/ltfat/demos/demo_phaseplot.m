%DEMO_PHASEPLOT  Give demos of nice phaseplots
%
%   This script creates a synthetic signal and then uses PHASEPLOT on it,
%   using several of the possible options.
% 
%   For real-life signal only small parts should be analyzed. In the chosen
%   demo the fundamental frequency of the speaker can be nicely seen.
%
%   Figure 1: Synthetic signal
%
%      Compare this to the pictures in reference 2 and 3. In 
%      the first two figures a synthetic signal is analyzed. It consists of a 
%      sinusoid, a small Delta peak, a periodic triangular function and a 
%      Gaussian. In the time-invariant version in the first part the periodicity 
%      of the sinusoid can be nicely seen also in the phase coefficients. Also
%      the points of discontinuities can be seen as asymptotic lines approached
%      by parabolic shapes. In the third part both properties, periodicity and 
%      discontinuities can be nicely seen. A comparison to the spectogram shows 
%      that the rectangular part in the middle of the signal can be seen by the
%      phase plot, but not by the spectogram.
% 
%      In the frequency-invariant version, the fundamental frequency of the
%      sinusoid can still be guessed as the position of an horizontal
%      asymptotic line.
%
%   Figure 2: Synthetic signal, thresholded.
%
%      This figure shows the same as Figure 1, except that values with low
%      magnitude has been removed.
%
%   Figure 3: Speech signal.
%
%      The figure shows a part of the 'linus' signal. The fundamental
%      frequency of the speaker can be nicely seen.
