%DEMO_AUDSCALES  Plot of the different auditory scales
%
%   This demos generates a simple figure that shows the behaviour of
%   the different audiory scales in the frequency range from 0 to 8000 Hz.
%
%   Figure 1: Auditory scales
%
%      The figure shows the behaviour of the audiory scales on a normalized
%      frequency plot.
