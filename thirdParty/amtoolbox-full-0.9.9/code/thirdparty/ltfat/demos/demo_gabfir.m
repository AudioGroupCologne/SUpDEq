%DEMO_GABFIR  Working with FIR windows
%
%   This demo demonstrates how to work with FIR windows in Gabor systems.
%
%   FIR windows are the windows traditionally used in signal processing.
%   They are short, much shorter than the signal, and this is used to make
%   effecient algorithms. They are also the only choice for applications
%   involving streaming data.
%
%   It is very easy to compute a spectrogram or Gabor coefficients using a
%   FIR window. The hard part is reconstruction, because both the window and
%   the dual window used for reconstruction must be FIR, and this is hard
%   to obtain, if the window is longer than the number of channels.
%
%   This demo demonstrates two methods:
%
%     1) Using a Gabor frame with a simple structure, for which dual/tight
%        FIR windows are easy to construct. This is a very common
%        technique in traditional signal processing, but it limits the
%        choice of windows and lattice parameters.
%
%     2) Cutting a canonical dual/tight window. We compute the canonical
%        dual window of the analysis window, and cut away the parts that
%        are close to zero. This will work for any analysis window and
%        any lattice constant, but the reconstruction obtained is not
%        perfect.
%
%   Figure 1: Hanning FIR window
%
%      This figure shows the a Hanning window in the time domain and its
%      magnitude response.
%
%   Figure 2: Kaiser-Bessel FIR window
%
%      This figure shows a Kaiser Bessel window and its magnitude response,
%      and the same two plots for the canonical dual of the window.
%
%   Figure 3: Gaussian FIR window for low redundancy
%
%      This figure shows a truncated Gaussian window and its magnitude
%      response. The same two plots are show for the truncated canonical
%      dual window.
%
%   Figure 4: Almost tight Gaussian FIR window
%
%      This figure shows a tight Gaussian window that has been truncated
%      and its magnitude response.

% The lattice constants to use.
a=16;
M=2*a;

% When working with FIR windows, some routines (gabdualnorm, magresp)
% require a transform length. Strictly speaking, this should be infinity,
% but this is not possible in the current implementation. Choosing an
% LLong that is some high multiple of M provides a very good approximation
% of the correct result.

% with a Gabor system where the number of channels is larger than or
% equal to the length of the window.

% -------- second part: True, short FIR window -------------------------

% If the length of the window is less than or equal to the number of
