%DEMO_PHASERET Phase retrieval and phase difference
%
%   This demo demonstrates iterative reconstruction of a spectrogram and
%   the phase difference.
%
%   Figure 1: Original spectrogram
%
%      This figure shows the target spectrogram of an excerpt of the gspi
%      signal
%
%   Figure 2: Phase difference
%
%      This figure shows a difference between the original phase and the 
%      reconstructed using 100 iterations of a Fast Griffin-Lim algorithm.
%      Note: The figure in the LTFAT 2.0 paper differs slightly because it
%      is genarated using 1000 iterations.
