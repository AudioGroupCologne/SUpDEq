%DEMO_FRSYNABS  Construction of a signal with a given spectrogram
%
%   This demo demonstrates iterative reconstruction of a spectrogram.
%
%   Figure 1: Original spectrogram
%
%      This figure shows the target spectrogram
%
%   Figure 2: Linear reconstruction
%
%      This figure shows a spectrogram of a linear reconstruction of the
%      target spectrogram.
%
%   Figure 3: Iterative reconstruction using the Griffin-Lim method.
%
%      This figure shows a spectrogram of an iterative reconstruction of the
%      target spectrogram using the Griffin-Lim projection method.
%
%   Figure 4: Iterative reconstruction using the BFGS method.
%
%      This figure shows a spectrogram of an iterative reconstruction of the
%      target spectrogram using the BFGS method.
%
%   The BFGS method makes use of the minFunc software. To use the BFGS method, 
%   please install the minFunc software from:
%   http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/Software/minFunc.html.
