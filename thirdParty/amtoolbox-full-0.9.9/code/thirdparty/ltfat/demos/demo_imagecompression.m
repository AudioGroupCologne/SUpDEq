%DEMO_IMAGECOMPRESSION  Image compression using N-term approximation
%
%   This demo shows how to perform a simple imagecompression using either
%   a Wilson basis or a Wavelet. The compression step is done by
%   retaining only 5% of the coefficients. 
%
%   Figure 1: Wilson and WMDCT basis
%
%      This right figure shows the image compressed using a DWILT basis with
%      8 channels. This corresponds quite closely to JPEG compression,
%      except that the borders between neigbouring blocs are smoother,
%      since the DWILT uses a windowing function.
%
%      The left figure shows the same, now
%      using a MDCT basis. The MDCT produces more visible artifacts, as the
%      slowest changing frequency in each block has a half-wave
%      modulation. This is visible on otherwise smooth backgrounds.
%
%   Figure 2: Wavelet
%
%      The Wavelet used is the DB6 with J=5 levels. On the right figure
%      the standard layout has been used, on the left the tensor layout
%      was used.
