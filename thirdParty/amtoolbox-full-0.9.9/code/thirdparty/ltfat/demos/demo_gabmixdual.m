%DEMO_GABMIXDUAL  How to use GABMIXDUAL
%
%   This script illustrates how one can produce dual windows
%   using GABMIXDUAL
%
%   The demo constructs a dual window that is more concentrated in
%   the time domain by mixing the original Gabor window by one that is
%   extremely well concentrated. The result is somewhat in the middle
%   of these two.
% 
%   The lower framebound of the mixing Gabor system is horrible,
%   but this does not carry over to the gabmixdual.
%
%   Figure 1: Gabmixdual of two Gaussians.
%
%      The first row of the figure shows the canonical dual window
%      of the input window, which is a Gaussian function perfectly
%      localized in the time and frequency domains.
%
%      The second row shows the canonical dual window of the window we
%      will be mixing with: This is a Gaussian that is 10 times more
%      concentrated in the time domain than in the frequency domain.
%      The resulting canonical dual window has rapid decay in the time domain.
%
%      The last row shows the gabmixdual of these two. This is a non-canonical
%      dual window of the first Gaussian, with decay resembling that of the
%      second.
