%DEMO_WFBT  Auditory filterbanks built using filterbank tree structures
%
%   This demo shows two specific constructions of wavelet filterbank trees
%   using several M-band filterbanks with possibly different M (making the
%   thee non-homogenous) in order to approximate auditory frequency bands 
%   and a musical scale respectively.  Both wavelet trees produce perfectly
%   reconstructable non-redundant representations. 
%
%   The constructions are the following:
%
%      1) Auditory filterbank, approximately dividing the frequency band 
%         into intervals reminisent of the bask scale.
%
%      2) Musical filterbank, approximately dividing the freq. band into
%         intervals reminicent of the well-tempered musical scale.
%         
%   Shapes of the trees were taken from fig. 8 and fig. 9 from the refernece.
%   Sampling frequency of the test signal is 48kHz as used in the article.

%      Both axes are in logarithmic scale.
