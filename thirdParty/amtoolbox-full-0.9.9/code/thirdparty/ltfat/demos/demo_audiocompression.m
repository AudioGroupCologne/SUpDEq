%DEMO_AUDIOCOMPRESSION  Audio compression using N-term approx
%
%   This demos shows how to do audio compression using best N-term
%   approximation of an WMDCT transform.
%
%   The signal is transformed using an orthonormal WMDCT transform.
%   Then approximations with a fixed number N of coefficients are obtained
%   by:
%
%      Linear approximation: The N coefficients with lowest frequency
%       index are kept.
%
%      Non-linear approximation: The N largest coefficients (in
%       magnitude) are kept.
%
%   The corresponding approximated signal can be computed using IWMDCT.
%
%   Figure 1: Rate-distorition plot
%
%      The figure shows the output Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) as a function
%      of the number of retained coefficients.
%
%   Note: The inverse WMDCT is not needed for computing computing
%   SNRs. Instead Parseval theorem states that the norm of a signal equals
%   the norm of the sequence of its WMDCT coefficients.
