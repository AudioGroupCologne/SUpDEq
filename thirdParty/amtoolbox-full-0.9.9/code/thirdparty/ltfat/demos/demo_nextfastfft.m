%DEMO_NEXTFASTFFT  Next fast FFT number
%
%   This demo shows the behaviour of the NEXTFASTFFT function.
%
%   Figure 1: Benchmark of the FFT routine
%
%      The figure shows the sizes returned by the NEXTFASTFFT function
%      compared to using nextpow2. As can be seen, the NEXTFASTFFT
%      approach gives FFT sizes that are much closer to the input size.
%
%   Figure 2: Efficiency of the table
%
%      The figure show the highest output/input ratio for varying input
%      sizes. As can be seen, the efficiency is better for larger input
%      values, where the output size is at most a few percent larger than
%      the input size.
