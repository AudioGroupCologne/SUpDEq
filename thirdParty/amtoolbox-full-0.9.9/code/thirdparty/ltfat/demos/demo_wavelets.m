%DEMO_WAVELETS  Wavelet filter banks
%
%   This demo exemplifies the use of the wavelet filter bank trees. All 
%   representations use "least asymmetric" Daubechies wavelet orthonormal
%   filters 'sym8' (8-regular, length 16).
%
%   Figure 1: DWT representation
%
%      The filter bank tree consists of 11 levels of iterated 2-band basic
%      wavelet filter bank, where only the low-pass output is further 
%      decomposed. This results in 12 bands with octave resolution. 
%
%   Figure 2: 8-band DWT representation
%
%      The filter bank tree (effectively) consists of 3 levels of iterated
%      8-band basic wavelet filter bank resulting in 22 bands. Only the
%      low-pass output is decomposed at each level.
%
%   Figure 3: Full Wavelet filter bank tree representation
%
%      The filter bank tree depth is 8 and it is fully decomposed meaning
%      both outputs (low-pass and high-pass) of the basic filter bank is
%      plot further. This results in 256 bands linearly covering the 
%      frequency axis.
%
%   Figure 4: Full Wavelet filter bank tree representation
%
%      The same case as before, but symmetric nearly orthogonal basic
%      filter bank is used.
%
%   Figure 5: Full Dual-tree Wavelet filter bank representation
%
%      This is a 2 times redundant representation using Q-shift dual-tree
%      wavelet filters.
