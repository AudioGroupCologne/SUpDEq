%DEMO_FILTERBANKSYNCHROSQUEEZE Filterbank synchrosqueezing and inversion
%
%   The demo shows that the synchrosqueezed filterbank representation can be 
%   directly used to reconstruct the original signal.
%   Since we do not work with a filterbank which forms a tight frame 
%   (its FILTERBANKRESPONSE is not constant) the direct reconstruction 
%   (mere summing all the channels) does not work well. We can fix that by
%   filtering (equalizing) the result by the inverse of the overall analysis 
%   filterbank frequency response.

%
%      The signal used is the first second from GSPI. Only the energy of
%      the coefficients is show. Both representations are in fact complex and
%      invertible.
%
%   Figure 2: Errors of the direct and the equalized reconstructions
%       
%      There is still a small DC offset of the signal obtained by the direct
%      summation.
