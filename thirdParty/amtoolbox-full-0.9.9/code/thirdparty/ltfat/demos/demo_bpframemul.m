%DEMO_BPFRAMEMUL Frame multiplier acting as a time-varying bandpass filter
%
%   This demo demonstrates creation and effect of a Gabor multiplier. The
%   multiplier performs a time-varying bandpass filtering. The band-pass
%   filter with center frequency changing over time is explicitly created
%   but it is treated as a "black box" system. The symbol is identified by
%   "probing" the system with a white noise and dividing DGT of the output
%   by DGT of the input element-wise. The symbol is smoothed out by a 5x5
%   median filter.
%
%   Figure 1: The symbol of the multiplier.
%
%      This figure shows a symbol used in the Gabor multiplier.
%
%   Figure 2: Spectroram obtained by re-analysis of the test signal after applying the multiplier
%
%      This figure shows a spectrogram of the test signal after applying
%      the estimated Gabor multiplier.
