function outsig=frsyn(F,insig);
%FRSYN  Frame synthesis operator
%   Usage: f=frsyn(F,c);
%
%   f=FRSYN(F,c) constructs a signal f from the frame coefficients c*
%   using the frame F. The frame object F must have been created using
%   FRAME.
%
%   Examples:
%   ---------
%
%   In the following example a signal f is constructed through the frame
%   synthesis operator using a Gabor frame. The coefficients associated with 
%   this Gabor expansion are contained in an identity matrix. The identity 
%   matrix corresponds to a diagonal in the time-frequency plane, that is, 
%   one atom at each time position with increasing frequency.:
%
%      a = 10;
%      M = 40;
%
%      F = frame('dgt', 'gauss', a, M);
%
%      c = framenative2coef(F, eye(40));
%
%      f = frsyn(F, c);
