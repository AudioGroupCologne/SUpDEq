function [Ncoef, L]=frameclength(F,Ls)
%FRAMECLENGTH  Number of coefficients from length of signal
%   Usage: Ncoef=frameclength(F,Ls);
%          [Ncoef,L]=frameclength(...);
%
%   Ncoef=FRAMECLENGTH(F,Ls) returns the total number of coefficients 
%   obtained by applying the analysis operator of frame F to a signal
%   of length Ls i.e. size(frana(F,f),1) for Ls=length(f). 
%
%   [Ncoef,L]=FRAMECLENGTH(F,Ls) additionally returns L, which is the 
%   same as returned by FRAMELENGTH.
%
%   If the frame length L is longer than the signal length Ls, the 
%   signal will be zero-padded to L by FRANA.
