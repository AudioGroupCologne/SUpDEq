function L=framelength(F,Ls);
%FRAMELENGTH  Frame length from signal
%   Usage: L=framelength(F,Ls);
%
%   FRAMELENGTH(F,Ls) returns the length of the frame F, such that
%   F is long enough to expand a signal of length Ls.
%
%   If the frame length is longer than the signal length, the signal will be
%   zero-padded by FRANA.
%
%   If instead a set of coefficients are given, call FRAMELENGTHCOEF.
%
