%FRAMECOEF2TFPLOT  Convert coefficients to time-frequency plane matrix
%   Usage: cout=framecoef2tfplot(F,cin);
%
%   FRAMECOEF2TFPLOT(F,coef) converts the frame coefficients coef into
%   the time-frequency plane layout matrix. The frame object F must have 
%   been created using FRAME. The function acts exactly as 
%   FRAMECOEF2TF for frames which admit regular (rectangular) sampling
%   of a time-frequency plane and converts irregularly sampled coefficients
%   to a rectangular matrix. This is usefull for custom plotting.
