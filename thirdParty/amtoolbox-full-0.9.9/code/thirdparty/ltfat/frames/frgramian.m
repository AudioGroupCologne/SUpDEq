function o = frgramian(c, Fa, Fs)
%FRGRAMIAN Frame Gramian operator
%   Usage:  o=frgramian(c, F);
%           o=frgramian(c, Fa, Fs);
%
%   Input parameters:
%          c    : Input coefficients
%          Fa   : Analysis frame
%          Fs   : Synthesis frame
%
%   Output parameters: 
%          o    : Output coefficients
%     
%   o=FRGRAMIAN(c,F) applies the Gramian operator or Gram matrix of the 
%   frame F. The entries of the Gram matrix are the inner products of the 
%   frame elements of F. The frame must have been created using FRAME.
%   If the frame F is a Parseval frame, the Gramian operator is a projection 
%   onto the range of the frame analysis operator.
%
%   o=FRGRAMIAN(c, Fa, Fs) applies the (cross) Gramian operator with the 
%   frames Fa and Fs. Here Fs is the frame associated with the frame
%   synthesis operator and Fa the frame that is associated with the 
%   frame analysis operator. The entries of the matrix that is constructed
%   through the Gramian operator are the inner products of the frame 
%   elements of Fa and Fs.
%   If Fa and Fs are canonical dual frames, the Gramian operator is a 
%   projection onto the range of the frame analysis operator.
