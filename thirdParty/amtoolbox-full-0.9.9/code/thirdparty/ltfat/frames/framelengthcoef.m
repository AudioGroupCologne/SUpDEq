function L=framelengthcoef(F,Ncoef);
%FRAMELENGTHCOEF  Frame length from coefficients
%   Usage: L=framelengthcoef(F,Ncoef);
%
%   FRAMELENGTHCOEF(F,Ncoef) returns the length of the frame F, such that
%   F is long enough to expand the coefficients of length Ncoef.
%
%   If instead a signal is given, call FRAMELENGTH.
%
%   See also: frame, framelength
