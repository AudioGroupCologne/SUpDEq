function test_extended_ltfat()
% This test suite runs extended tests which either:
%   
%    Take long time to finish
%   
%    Their failure can only be checked by inspecting plots
%
%    We do not care whether they work with single precision or not.
%
%    Any that should be run at least before doing the release
%    but do not fit to be included in test_all_ltfat
