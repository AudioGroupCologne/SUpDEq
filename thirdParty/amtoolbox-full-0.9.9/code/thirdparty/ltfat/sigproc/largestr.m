function [xo,Nout]=largestr(xi,p,varargin)
%LARGESTR   Keep fixed ratio of largest coefficients
%   Usage:  xo=largestr(x,p);
%           xo=largestr(x,p,mtype);  
%           [xo,N]=largestr(...);
%
%   LARGESTR(x,p) returns an array of the same size as x keeping
%   the fraction p of the coefficients. The coefficients with the largest
%   magnitude are kept.
%
%   [xo,n]=LARGESTR(xi,p) additionally returns the number of coefficients
%   kept.
% 
%   *Note:* If the function is used on coefficients coming from a
%   redundant transform or from a transform where the input signal was
%   padded, the coefficient array will be larger than the original input
%   signal. Therefore, the number of coefficients kept might be higher than
%   expected.
%
%   LARGESTR takes the following flags at the end of the line of input
%   arguments:
%
%     'hard'    Perform hard thresholding. This is the default.
%
%     'wiener'  Perform empirical Wiener shrinkage. This is in between
%               soft and hard thresholding.
%
%     'soft'    Perform soft thresholding.  
%
%     'full'    Returns the output as a full matrix. This is the default.
%
%     'sparse'  Returns the output as a sparse matrix.   
%
%   *Note:* If soft- or Wiener thresholding is selected, one less
%   coefficient will actually be returned. This is caused by that
%   coefficient being set to zero.
