function outsig=rampup(L,wintype)
%RAMPUP  Rising ramp function
%   Usage: outsig=rampup(L);
%
%   RAMPUP(L) will return a rising ramp function of length L. The
%   ramp is a sinusoide starting from zero and ending at one. The ramp
%   is centered such that the first element is always 0 and the last
%   element is not quite 1, such that the ramp fits with following ones.
%
%   RAMPUP(L,wintype) will use another window for ramping. This may be any
%   of the window types from FIRWIN. Please see the help on FIRWIN for
%   more information. The default is to use a piece of the Hann window.
