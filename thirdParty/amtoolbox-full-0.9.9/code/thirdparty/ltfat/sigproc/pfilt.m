function c=pfilt(f,g,varargin)
%PFILT  Apply filter with periodic boundary conditions
%   Usage:  h=pfilt(f,g);
%           h=pfilt(f,g,a,dim);
%
%   PFILT(f,g) applies the filter g to the input f. If f is a
%   matrix, the filter is applied along each column.
%
%   PFILT(f,g,a) does the same, but downsamples the output keeping only
%   every a'th sample (starting with the first one).
%
%   PFILT(f,g,a,dim) filters along dimension dim. The default value of
%   [] means to filter along the first non-singleton dimension.
%
%   The filter g can be a vector, in which case the vector is treated
%   as a zero-delay FIR filter.
%
%   The filter g can be a cell array. The following options are
%   possible:
%
%      If the first element of the cell array is the name of one of the
%       windows from FIRWIN, the whole cell array is passed onto
%       FIRFILTER.
%
%      If the first element of the cell array is 'bl', the rest of the
%       cell array is passed onto BLFILTER.
%
%      If the first element of the cell array is 'pgauss', 'psech',
%       the rest of the parameters is passed onto the respective
%       function. Note that you do not need to specify the length L.
%
%   The coefficients obtained from filtering a signal f by a filter g are
%   defined by
%
%               L-1
%      c(n+1) = sum f(l+1) * g(an-l+1)
%               l=0
%
%   where an-l is computed modulo L.
