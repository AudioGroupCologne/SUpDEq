function ggd = pgrpdelay(g,L)
%PGRPDELAY Group delay of a filter with periodic boundaries
%   Usage:  ggd = pgrpdelay(g,L);
%
%   PGRPDELAY(g,L) computes group delay of filter g as a negative
%   derivative of the phase frequency response of filter g assuming
%   periodic (cyclic) boundaries i.e. the delay may be a negative number.
%   The derivative is calculated using the second order centered difference
%   approximation. 
%   The resulting group delay is in samples.
%
%   Example:
%   --------
%
%   The following example shows a group delay of causal, moving average
%   6tap FIR filter and it's magnitude frequency response for comparison.
%   The dips in the group delay correspond to places where modulus of the 
%   frequency response falls to zero.:
%
%      g = struct(struct('h',ones(6,1),'offset',0)); 
%      L = 512;
%      figure(1);
%      subplot(2,1,1);
%      plot(-L/2+1:L/2,fftshift(pgrpdelay(g,512)));
%      axis tight;ylim([0,4]);
%
%      subplot(2,1,2);
%      magresp(g,L,'nf');
