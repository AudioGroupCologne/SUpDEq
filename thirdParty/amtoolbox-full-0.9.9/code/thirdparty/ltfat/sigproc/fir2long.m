function gout=fir2long(gin,Llong);
%FIR2LONG   Extend FIR window to LONG
%   Usage:  g=fir2long(g,Llong);
%
%   FIR2LONG(g,Llong) will extend the FIR window g to a length Llong*
%   window by inserting zeros. Note that this is a slightly different
%   behaviour than MIDDLEPAD.
%
%   FIR2LONG can also be used to extend a FIR window to a longer FIR
%   window, for instance in order to satisfy the usual requirement that the
%   window length should be divisible by the number of channels.
%
%   If the input to FIR2LONG is a cell, FIR2LONG will recurse into
%   the cell array.
