function [xo,Nout]=largestn(xi,N,varargin)
%LARGESTN   Keep N largest coefficients
%   Usage:  xo=largestn(x,N);
%           xo=largestn(x,N,mtype);
%
%   LARGESTN(x,N) returns an array of the same size as x keeping
%   the N largest coefficients.
%
%   LARGESTN takes the following flags at the end of the line of input
%   arguments:
%
%     'hard'    Perform hard thresholding. This is the default.
%
%     'wiener'  Perform empirical Wiener shrinkage. This is in between
%               soft and hard thresholding.
%
%     'soft'    Perform soft thresholding.  
%
%     'full'    Returns the output as a full matrix. This is the default.
%
%     'sparse'  Returns the output as a sparse matrix.   
%
%   If the coefficients represents a signal expanded in an orthonormal
%   basis then this will be the best N-term approximation.
%
%   *Note:* If soft- or Wiener thresholding is selected, only N-1
%   coefficients will actually be returned. This is caused by the N*'th
%   coefficient being set to zero.
