To use the toolbox, 'cd' to the LTFAT directory and execute 'ltfatstart'.

In Octave you can put this command in your ~/.octaverc file.

Directory struture.

The toolbox is organized in subdirectories including the following:

  fourier     - Fourier analysis, DCT/DST transforms and filtering.
  gabor       - Gabor, Wilson and WMDCT analysis/synthesis functions.
  wavelets    - Wavelet analysis/synthesis, wavelet filter banks
  filterbank  - General and auditory inspired filterbanks. 
  nonstatgab  - Non-stationary Gabor frames.
  quadratic   - Quadratic distributions
  frames      - Frame objects and linear operators associated with frames.
  sigproc     - A collection of simple, signal processing tools.
  blockproc   - Methods for block processing and block-adapted transforms.
  auditory    - Auditory scales and common filters types.
  demos       - Demos showing applications or aspects of LTFAT functions.
  signals     - Test signals for use with the examples.
  comp        - Computational subroutines.
                These should not be called directly.
  src         - C implementation of the most computationally intensive
                routines.
  mex         - Mex files to speed up the toolbox (if compiled)
  oct         - Octave C++-files to speed up the toolbox (if compiled)

The file INSTALL contains instructions for compiling the C-library and 
the Octave and Matlab interfaces.
