%DRIHACZEKDIST discrete Rihaczek distribution
%   Usage r = drihaczekdist(f);
%
%
%   DRIHACZEKDIST(f) computes a discrete Rihaczek distribution of vector
%   f. The discrete Rihaczek distribution is computed by
%
%   where k, l=0,...,L-1 and c is the Fourier transform of f.
%
%   *WARNING**: The quadratic time-frequency distributions are highly 
%   redundant. For an input vector of length L, the quadratic time-frequency
%   distribution will be a L xL matrix. If f is multichannel 
%   (LxW matrix), the resulting distributions are stacked along
%   the third dimension such that the result is LxL xW cube.
