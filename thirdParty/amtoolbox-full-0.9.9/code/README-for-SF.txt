The "amtoolbox-x.x.x.zip" file contains Matlab/Octave scripts and source codes (C++, C, Python) of the models.
The "amtoolbox-full-x.x.x.zip" file contains toolboxes LFTAT, SOFA, and SFS installed.

For the installation follow the documentation on amtstart from <http://amtoolbox.sourceforge.net/>.

Most of the experiments require auxiliary data. The auxdata will be automatically downloaded on demand from <http://sofacoustics.org/data/>.

Some of the AMT functions require a large processing time. Depending on the machine and the model, it might take even days. Thus, some AMT functions provide caching of calculated results. When started in the default mode, the cached results will be automatically downloaded. 

Have much fun!
