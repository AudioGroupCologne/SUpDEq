%DATA_PULKKI2001 Listener-specific panning angles judged best in median
%plane listening test with pink noise
%   Usage: data = data_pulkki2001
%
%   Output parameter:
%     data	: experimental data matrix with dimensions: source angle x listener x trial
%
%   DATA_PULKKI2001 returns listener-specific experimental data
%   from Figure 8 in Pullki (2001; J AES; 49:753-767). Source angle I and II 
%   were at 0 and 15degrees elevation, respectivley. Adjustments were conducted 
%   four times to each source angle and the loudspeaker span was 45 degrees.
