function [hrir_data, hrir_angles, errorsig] = enzner2008(x, y, P)
%ENZNER2008  Calculate HRIR set using the method of Enzner et al. (2008)
%   Usage: [hrir_data,hrir_angles,fs] = enzner2008(mu,delta_phi,...)
%
%   Input parameters:
%     x : reference signal (excitation signal used for the measurements)
%
%     y : recorded binaural signal
%
%     P : structure with parameters
%
%       .mu          : NLMS stepzize, e.g., 0.75 or 1
%
%       .delta_phi   : azimuthal resolution (delta_phi) in degree to store
%                      hrir,e.g., 0.1 or 1
%
%       .h_length : length of the impulse responses in samples, e.g., 256 (or 308 for single channel perfect sweeps)
%
%       .adapt : overhead at the end and the beginnig, depends on the recording. 
%          No. of symmetrically overlapping samples of the recorded ear signals
%          arround phi = 180 deg, used as adaptation buffer before HRIR data will
%          be stored, also used to shift the algorithm's input signals to enshure
%          causality, e.g, .adapt = 20000 for the given examples
%
%       .sys_latency : system latency, No. of samples to shift the input signals against
%          each other (ensure causality), e.g. 30 if using a reference
%          recording or -290 if using loudspeaker driving signals(playback signals)
%          whereupon the loudspeaker distance is approx. 2 m (fs = 44100)
%
%   Output parameters:
%     hrir_data : sampled HRIR data at the azimuth-resolution delta_phi with the structure: 
%
%       hrir_data(filter coefficients, left/right, no. of channels, azimuthal index)
%
%       filter coefficients: see h_length
%
%       left/right: 1 = left, 2 = right
%
%       no. of channels: allways 1 (single channel NLMS-algorithm)
%
%       azimuthal index: corresponding to an azimuth phi. The rotational direction during the
%         recording of the ear signals is counterclockwise! (1 = -180 deg, 2 = -180 deg + delta_phi, end = 180 deg - delta_phi )
%
%     hrir_angles : vector with azimuthal angles corresponding to the azimuthal index of hrir_data
%
%     errorsig: error signal (???)
%
%   ENZNER2008 calculates a set of HRIRs using the normalized LMS-algorithm.
%   A test signal in mono, e.g., white noise, perfect sweeps, or a reference
%   recording at the position in the middle of the listeners head is used as
%   the input of the algorithm, whereas the other input of the algorithm is
%   given by the corresponding spatially-continuous (i.e., dynamical) binaural
%   recording.
%
%   This recording contains the measured ear signals along the trajectory of
%   interest, e.g., the horizontal plane, plus some symmetric overhead.  The
%   overhead is used to ensure capturing of all data of interest, to give the
%   algorithm a scope to adapt and to be able to shift the signals against
%   each other to ensure causality (see sys_latency). The binaural recording
%   of the ear signals has to begin/end at the rear of the subject.  Thus the
%   first recorded sample number subsequent to the required overhead (see
%   adapt) corresponds to an azimuth of phi = 180Â° (rear).
%
%   From a given set of example files, the HRIR data will be calculated. Per
%   default the measured ear signals (stimulus: white noise) and the
%   corresponding reference recording will be used for the computation. If
%   you want to use the loudspeaker driving signals or a perfect sweep data
%   set, please uncomment only the case of interest in the section
%   "changeable parameters" in lines 74-104. In this section you can also
%   adjust the used filter length.
%
%   The computation is performed continuously for each sample, in compliance with
%   a continuous-azimuth HRIR representation. The storage of the HRIR data is
%   sampled with an arbitrary azimuth-spacing delta_phi. The HRIR data will be
%   written into the array hrir_data.
