%
%   Input parameters:
%       insig       : binaural signal for which the cross-correlation
%                     should be calculated
%       fs          : sampling rate (Hz)
%
%   Output parameters:
%       crosscorr   : A matrix containing the cross-correlation signal
%                     for every frequency channel fc and every time step n.
%                     The format of this matrix is output(n,m,fc), where m*
%                     denotes the correlation (delay line) time step.
%       t           : time axis for the time steps n in crosscorr
%       ild         : interaural level difference (ILD) for every freqeuncy
%                     channel fc*
%       cfreq       : center frequencies of every frequency channel
%
%   LINDEMANN1986(insig,fs) calculates a binaural activity map for the given
%   insig using a cross-correlation (delay-line) mechanism. The calculation
%   is done for every frequency band in the range 5-40 Erb.
%
%   Lindemann has extended the delay line model of Jeffres (1948) by a
%   contralateral inhibition, which introduce the ILD to the model.  Also
%   monaural detectors were extended, to handle monaural signals (and some
%   stimuli with a split off of the lateralization image). Hess has
%   extented the output from the Lindemann model to a binaural activity map
%   dependend on time, by using a running cross-correlation function.
%   This has been done here by starting a new running cross-correlation
%   every time step T_int.  A detailed description of these cross-
%   correlation steps is given in the LINDEMANN1986_BINCORR function.
%
%   The steps of the binaural model to calculate the result are the
%   following:
%
%   1) The given stimulus is filtered using an erb bank to
%      get 36 frequency bands containing a stimulus waveform.
%
%   2) In a second step the auditory nerve is siumulated by extracting the
%      envelope using a first order low pass filter with a cutoff frequency
%      of 800 Hz and half-wave rectification.
%
%   3) Calculation of the cross-correlation between the left and right
%      channel.  This is done using the model described in Lindemann
%      (1986a) and Hess (2007). These are extensions to the delay line model
%      of Jeffres (1948).

%   ---------
%
%   This example shows how to the binaural activity map for one frequency
%   channel of the Lindemann binaural model for a sinusoid with a binaural
%   modulation rate of 2 Hz. :
%     
%     fs = 44100; % Sampling rate    
%     f = 500;    % Frequency of the sinusoid
%     mf = 2;     % Binaural modulation frequency
%
%     % Generate 1~s binaural modulated sinusoid
%     sig = sig_lindemann1986(f,mf,fs);
%
%     % Model paramter (Note: T_int (ms) should be a multiple of 1000/f == 2)
%     % Begin of the storage of the cross-correlation is set to 1, because we have a
%     % non-stationary signal
%
%     % Calculate binaural cross-correlation
%     [cc,t] = lindemann1986(sig,fs,'T_int',6);
