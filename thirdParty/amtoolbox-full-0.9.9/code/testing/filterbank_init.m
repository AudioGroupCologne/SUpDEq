function fb=filterbank_init(b,a,varargin);
%FILTERBANK_INIT  Wrapper around filter to multiple filters
%   Usage: outsig=filterbank_init(b,a);
%          outsig=filterbank_init(b,a,nsigs,hopsize);
%
%   fb=FILTERBANK_INIT(b,a) creates a filterbank structure fb for use with
%   FILTERBANK_BLOCK. The filterbank will filter the input signals with the
%   filters described in b and a.
%
%   fb=FILTERBANK_INIT(b,a,nsigs) does the same assuming that the input
%   to FILTERBANK_BLOCK will consist of nsigs signal at once.
