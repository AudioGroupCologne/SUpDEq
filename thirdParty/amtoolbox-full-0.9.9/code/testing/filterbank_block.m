function [outsig,fb]=filterbank_block(insig,fb)
%FILTERBANK_BLOCK  Process signal block in a filterbank
%   Usage: [outsig,fb]=filterbank(fb,insig);
%
%   [outsig,fb]=FILTERBANK_BLOCK(insig,fb) filters a block of input using the
%   filters described in the structrure fb. The structure fb must first
%   have been created using FILTERBANK_INIT.
%
%   If insig is a matrix then filtering is applied along the columns. In
%   this case, the output will be 3-dimensional. First dimension
%   is time, second dimension is frequency channel and third dimension
%   corresponds to the columns of the input signal.
