%LYON2011_IHCSTEP update of inner-hair-cell (IHC) model
%
%   Usage: [ihc_out, state] = lyon2011_ihcstep(filters_out, coeffs, state);
%
%   LYON2011_IHCSTEP updates the inner-hair-cell (IHC) model, including the
%   detection nonlinearity and one or two capacitor state variables. This 
%   file is part of an implementation of Lyon's cochlear model:
%   "Cascade of Asymmetric Resonators with Fast-Acting Compression"
